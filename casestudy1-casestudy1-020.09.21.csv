                    ARTICLE                 LOG IN By now, many organisations have had time to experiment and have discovered DevOps disciplines can improve or even transform operations. According to Deloitte, adopting DevOps will lead to an 18% to 21% reduction in time to production and time to change.  Perhaps more than process changes, DevOps culture can help teams do the previously “impossible”: breaking down silos between business, IT, engineers, and managers. And this may be the most significant effect as increased and consistent levels of productivity, efficiency, and service delivery are prioritised in the uncertain years ahead. While the nomenclature is new to some, the underlying goals of DevOps foster the most important aspects of effective teams since the inception of IT: genuine, engaged teamwork and shared responsibility. Some organisations go all-in on multidisciplinary blended teams, where operations, development, and business experts can collectively take responsibility for the life cycle of most aspects of the IT system. When everyone has ownership and visibility into technical domains and the customer journey, finger-pointing becomes unnecessary and unpopular. Other organisations retain developers and administrators in their existing silos or teams but develop new, open, and mutually beneficial inter-team communications, attracting the broader team to selected elements of DevOps culture. Regardless, team members collaborate, experiment, and add continuous improvements to their ongoing mission. Blame-free post-mortems, true sprint reviews, focused planning meetings, and more all provide useful and timely feedback, process improvement, and collaboration that ops professionals and developers both prefer. One driver for DevOps adoption today may also be less altruistic and more pragmatic. Greater emphasis on distributed applications, hybrid ops, software as a service (SaaS), and microservices requires monitoring application performance across elements wherever they’ve been modernised. Collective observability and the flexibility to quickly adapt and share production performance data can facilitate more effective team interaction on its own. In particular, it’s not unusual for DevOps teams to invest in application performance monitoring (APM) alongside or even ahead of infrastructure monitoring. With more collaboration between teams in the development of applications and services—as well as in managing the overall access and uptime of critical SaaS applications—many of the frustrations and performance degradations teams experience can be reduced. The feedback-oriented approach of DevOps is a natural fit for helping IT pros integrate APM into the business to measure impact.

Launching a broad initiative to adopt DevOps culture might seem like something to defer until business knows what this “new normal” will look like. But I’d argue the value it brings to IT teams of many different sizes can be key to enterprise’s transformation ambitions—digital, survival, or otherwise. DevOps doesn’t have to be a big-ticket item when you create quality around shared metrics and easy, empirical feedback for everyone on the team.  teams have an incentive to invest in expanding and tuning their monitoring systems. We aren’t perfectionists, but we’re fans of completeness. Gaps in visibility rub us the wrong way. When the specifics of technology, vendor, architecture, and operations styles take a back seat to overall service and change quality, silos tend to break down. APM removes the walls blocking teams from seeing the big picture, and entire organisations can benefit, especially for applications with multiple components crossing team boundaries. APM adoption may also be encouraged by the more academic associations of DevOps. Verified data and research-based decision processes are more typical among DevOps adherents and other modern IT teams. Collaboration between teams, especially in the more skeptical early days of culture change, is almost always improved by a shared view of reality. When everyone agrees on metrics and event analysis, it goes a long way. As improved access and uptime for critical applications becomes the norm, more admins turn to APM for critical, dispassionate shared ops truth. What’s often lost in conversations about the value of DevOps is just how frustrating performance degradations are for operations teams. Dev is first in “DevOps” because it’s primarily led by developers seeking to help ops reduce toil. Developers and ops admins have different DNA. Ops isn’t always quick to invest in instrumentation after a problem is resolved, and dev isn’t always eager to drink from a firehose of uncorrelated performance data from applications in production. This is natural—we choose our career focus based on our unique interests. However, both teams care about the business’ success and are eager to discover and incorporate the specific needs and behaviors of the business into their technical processes. Business should drive tech—not the other way around—and IT should never be its own largest customer. APM systems tend to be common ground where ops can expand visibility while responding to an endless incident queue. At the same time, they should provide concise, digested feedback to dev that doesn’t require data science to be useful.

Perhaps you’re already part of a team relying on APM as a component of their monitoring and observability strategy. But if you’re not, ask others in the operations community if they are. Chances are you’ll find there’s an overlap between businesses able to weather 2020 without significant challenges and those who added APM to their teams’ utility belts. It remains unclear what the “next normal” entails, but the fundamentals of great service delivery remain the same. The DevOps focus on flexibility and continuous process improvement to break transformation logjams comes in handy when the future of technology is full of new possibility.

 We’ve discussed the notion of cloud architecture optimization here in the past. Now it’s time to understand how it’s measured. You really have no way to prove your architecture isn’t optimized unless you do an audit, which includes a review of the solution’s approach and any attached costs. In the past, the people who built and deployed cloud solutions were reluctant to have their choices questioned. These days, because we want the most value from the cloud solutions, many have changed their minds about questions and oversight—or more often, company leadership changed their minds for them. Many of the projects I take on these days focus on review and improvement audits rather than on build and migrate deployments. Once everything works in cloud architectures, you can deploy and operationalize. Just because it works does not mean that it’s optimized. If you look at the differences between your architecture and one that’s optimized, you could have a “working” solution that costs you millions of dollars each week.",to present this visually see the figure below. note that positions  and  are the least optimized. they cost more money and are the most inefficient.  by david linthicum infoworld weve discussed the notion of cloud architecture optimization here in the past. now its time to understand how its measured. you really have no way to prove your architecture isnt optimized unless you do an audit which includes a review of the solutions approach and any attached costs. in the past the people who built and deployed cloud solutions were reluctant to have their choices questioned. these days because we want the most value from the cloud solutions many have changed their minds about questions and oversightor more often company leadership changed their minds for them. many of the projects i take on these days focus on review and improvement audits rather than on build and migrate deployments. once everything works in cloud architectures you can deploy and operationalize. just because it works does not mean that its optimized. if you look at the differences between your architecture and one thats optimized you could have a working solution that costs you millions of dollars each week.,12,0.075,0.844,0.081,0.0502,22.785358428955078,"['present', 'visual', 'see', 'figur', 'note', 'posit', 'least', 'optim', 'cost', 'money', 'ineffici', 'david', 'linthicum', 'infoworld', 'weve', 'discus', 'notion', 'cloud', 'architectur', 'optim', 'past', 'time', 'understand', 'measur', 'realli', 'way', 'prove', 'architectur', 'isnt', 'optim', 'unless', 'audit', 'includ', 'review', 'solut', 'approach', 'attach', 'cost', 'past', 'peopl', 'built', 'deploy', 'cloud', 'solut', 'reluct', 'choic', 'question', 'day', 'want', 'valu', 'cloud', 'solut', 'mani', 'chang', 'mind', 'question', 'oversightor', 'often', 'compani', 'leadership', 'chang', 'mind', 'mani', 'project', 'take', 'day', 'focus', 'review', 'improv', 'audit', 'rather', 'build', 'migrat', 'deploy', 'everyth', 'work', 'cloud', 'architectur', 'deploy', 'operation', 'work', 'mean', 'optim', 'look', 'differ', 'architectur', 'that', 'optim', 'could', 'work', 'solut', 'cost', 'million', 'dollar', 'week']",0.01175046619027853,0.0,0.9869704246520996,0.0,0.0,2,data; cloud; lake; team; amazon; need; work; busi; time; data_lake,Topic: 2,A foolproof way to understand cloud optimization  | InfoWorld,17,61,10.650963,3.7291543

When attempting to gain management support, it helps to provide a comprehensive framework of enterprise and security architecture costs, for example. Many executives are stuck in quarterly, expense-based, financial reporting logic. Neither enterprise nor security architecture should be considered an expense, as both are an investment. Additionally, they cannot just be measured in terms of savings or investment in a certain accounting period. They must be evaluated on their return on investment (ROI), which runs across several future accounting periods. This type of detailed evaluation is key in today’s environment, where financial means are limited. Additionally, solutions should not only be directed at resolving a problem but should guide management to approach problems differently.

This methodology is based on years of experience and best practices. It ensures that business needs drive the functional, technical, and implementation aspects of the enterprise architectures we create for customers. Using the GM ITSA methodology, we can also structure our security architecture and transformation work. It allows us to make architecture (and specifically security architecture) more of a repeatable science rather than an art. And because our methodology is repeatable, customers receive more value for their money.   Security architects must consider the input from all stakeholders who interface with and work with or are somehow linked to the new architecture or solution. In HPE’s GM ITSA architectural methodology, this strategy is reflected in four viewpoints: the business, functional, technical and implementation views. Each view builds on the previous one (in the order shown above). Ultimately, the requirements defined in the different views can all be linked back to a clear business need. The business view is the view that summarizes the needs and drivers of the business owners of the new solution or architecture. For example, today’s business owners are especially worried about reputational damage caused by malware attacks or data loss (business view). These concerns drive departmental and project owners to put more emphasis on remote workforce protection, which affects the security of the IT tools these workers use (hardware and software). It also affects the protection of remote workers’ identity and, most importantly, the protection of corporate data (functional view). Architects, IT designers, and implementers can then translate these requirements into additional host protection, novel security operations and management, strong authentication, data loss prevention, data encryption, and integrity protection controls and solutions (technical and implementation views).",get it right the first time with hpe  lets look at hpes architectural methodology at hpe we support an enterprise and security architectural methodology called the global method for it solution architecture gm itsa. this methodology is based on years of experience and best practices. it ensures that business needs drive the functional technical and implementation aspects of the enterprise architectures we create for customers. using the gm itsa methodology we can also structure our security architecture and transformation work. it allows us to make architecture and specifically security architecture more of a repeatable science rather than an art. and because our methodology is repeatable customers receive more value for their money.  security architects must consider the input from all stakeholders who interface with and work with or are somehow linked to the new architecture or solution. in hpes gm itsa architectural methodology this strategy is reflected in four viewpoints the business functional technical and implementation views. each view builds on the previous one in the order shown above. ultimately the requirements defined in the different views can all be linked back to a clear business need. the business view is the view that summarizes the needs and drivers of the business owners of the new solution or architecture. for example todays business owners are especially worried about reputational damage caused by malware attacks or data loss business view. these concerns drive departmental and project owners to put more emphasis on remote workforce protection which affects the security of the it tools these workers use hardware and software. it also affects the protection of remote workers identity and most importantly the protection of corporate data functional view. architects it designers and implementers can then translate these requirements into additional host protection novel security operations and management strong authentication data loss prevention data encryption and integrity protection controls and solutions technical and implementation views.,15,0.038,0.824,0.138,0.9832,22.796560287475586,"['right', 'first', 'time', 'hpe', 'let', 'look', 'hpes', 'architectur', 'methodolog', 'hpe', 'support', 'enterpris', 'secur', 'architectur', 'methodolog', 'call', 'global', 'method', 'solut', 'architectur', 'itsa', 'methodolog', 'base', 'year', 'experi', 'best', 'practic', 'ensur', 'busi', 'need', 'drive', 'function', 'technic', 'implement', 'aspect', 'enterpris', 'architectur', 'creat', 'custom', 'use', 'itsa', 'methodolog', 'structur', 'secur', 'architectur', 'transform', 'work', 'allow', 'architectur', 'specif', 'secur', 'architectur', 'repeat', 'scienc', 'rather', 'art', 'methodolog', 'repeat', 'custom', 'receiv', 'valu', 'money', 'secur', 'architect', 'must', 'consid', 'input', 'stakehold', 'interfac', 'work', 'somehow', 'link', 'new', 'architectur', 'solut', 'hpes', 'itsa', 'architectur', 'methodolog', 'strategi', 'reflect', 'four', 'viewpoint', 'busi', 'function', 'technic', 'implement', 'view', 'view', 'build', 'previous', 'order', 'shown', 'ultim', 'requir', 'defin', 'differ', 'view', 'link', 'back', 'clear', 'busi', 'need', 'busi', 'view', 'view', 'summar', 'need', 'driver', 'busi', 'owner', 'new', 'solut', 'architectur', 'exampl', 'today', 'busi', 'owner', 'especi', 'worri', 'reput', 'damag', 'caus', 'malwar', 'attack', 'data', 'loss', 'busi', 'view', 'concern', 'drive', 'department', 'project', 'owner', 'put', 'emphasi', 'remot', 'workforc', 'protect', 'affect', 'secur', 'tool', 'worker', 'hardwar', 'softwar', 'affect', 'protect', 'remot', 'worker', 'ident', 'import', 'protect', 'corpor', 'data', 'function', 'view', 'architect', 'design', 'implement', 'translat', 'requir', 'addit', 'host', 'protect', 'novel', 'secur', 'oper', 'manag', 'strong', 'authent', 'data', 'loss', 'prevent', 'data', 'encrypt', 'integr', 'protect', 'control', 'solut', 'technic', 'implement', 'view']",0.0,0.029469238594174385,0.39584657549858093,0.06945306062698364,0.5051479935646057,4,user; cluster; standard; redi; group; select; architectur; control; access; new,Topic: 4,Evolving your security architecture with increasing agility and resiliency,21,74,10.702081,15.503207

manufacturers. A lot of this valuable data is sitting in places where
it’s hard to collect, compare, and take action on, like in old
machinery, isolated systems, spreadsheets, and even paper clipboards.   One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
opportunity. But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
daunting. Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data. Data-driven technology In some ways, data is to factories what oxygen is to humans. Oxygen is
all around us, but it doesn’t do us any good until we breathe it in.
Then we can use it to create energy. The more energy we have, the more
we can do. Manufacturers all over the world are sitting on mounds of
data that they aren’t “breathing in.” Truly, the journey to modern manufacturing begins with unlocking this
data. The ability to tap into that data is the difference between
factories that are “smart” and benefiting from new technology, like
automation, machine learning (ML), and AI, and those that are being held
back by outdated tools and systems.",where is this trapped data thats where the problem lies for manymanufacturers. a lot of this valuable data is sitting in places whereits hard to collect compare and take action on like in oldmachinery isolated systems spreadsheets and even paper clipboards.   one of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch differentindustries implement new technologies that improve and transformbusiness operations. manufacturing in particular has always captivatedmy attention in this respect. when i think about how amazons globallyconnected distribution network has changed in the last decade aloneits incredible. from the internet of things iot to artificialintelligence ai and task automation to predictive maintenancetechnology the advancements in this space are creating a world of newopportunity. but this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have beenaround for decades or longer. some of their equipment was designedbefore the internet even existed. if replacing this equipment isnt anoption how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modernmanufacturing the choice of what to embrace and where to start can bedaunting. ultimately the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturingis usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives producemore increase safety or increase qualityand all at a lower cost.the good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs toaccomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.its something theyve had since the moment they opened their doorswhether that was yesterday or  years ago data. datadriven technology in some ways data is to factories what oxygen is to humans. oxygen isall around us but it doesnt do us any good until we breathe it in.then we can use it to create energy. the more energy we have the morewe can do. manufacturers all over the world are sitting on mounds ofdata that they arent breathing in. truly the journey to modern manufacturing begins with unlocking thisdata. the ability to tap into that data is the difference betweenfactories that are smart and benefiting from new technology likeautomation machine learning ml and ai and those that are being heldback by outdated tools and systems.,20,0.042,0.827,0.13,0.9867,23.437511444091797,"['trap', 'data', 'that', 'problem', 'lie', 'manymanufactur', 'lot', 'valuabl', 'data', 'sit', 'place', 'whereit', 'hard', 'collect', 'compar', 'take', 'action', 'oldmachineri', 'isol', 'system', 'spreadsheet', 'even', 'paper', 'clipboard', 'reward', 'part', 'job', 'get', 'watch', 'differentindustri', 'implement', 'new', 'technolog', 'improv', 'transformbusi', 'oper', 'manufactur', 'particular', 'alway', 'captivatedmi', 'attent', 'respect', 'think', 'amazon', 'globallyconnect', 'distribut', 'network', 'chang', 'last', 'decad', 'aloneit', 'incred', 'internet', 'thing', 'iot', 'artificialintellig', 'task', 'autom', 'predict', 'maintenancetechnolog', 'advanc', 'space', 'creat', 'world', 'newopportun', 'complic', 'fact', 'mani', 'manufactur', 'beenaround', 'decad', 'longer', 'equip', 'designedbefor', 'internet', 'even', 'exist', 'replac', 'equip', 'isnt', 'anopt', 'manufactur', 'begin', 'journey', 'modernmanufactur', 'choic', 'embrac', 'start', 'bedaunt', 'ultim', 'reason', 'adopt', 'new', 'technolog', 'manufacturingi', 'usual', 'achiev', 'follow', 'object', 'producemor', 'increas', 'safeti', 'increas', 'qualityand', 'lower', 'cost', 'good', 'news', 'import', 'thing', 'manufactur', 'need', 'toaccomplish', 'object', 'someth', 'alreadi', 'someth', 'theyv', 'sinc', 'moment', 'open', 'doorswheth', 'yesterday', 'year', 'ago', 'data', 'datadriven', 'technolog', 'way', 'data', 'factori', 'oxygen', 'human', 'oxygen', 'isal', 'around', 'doesnt', 'good', 'breath', 'creat', 'energi', 'energi', 'morew', 'manufactur', 'world', 'sit', 'mound', 'ofdata', 'arent', 'breath', 'truli', 'journey', 'modern', 'manufactur', 'begin', 'unlock', 'thisdata', 'abil', 'tap', 'data', 'differ', 'betweenfactori', 'smart', 'benefit', 'new', 'technolog', 'likeautom', 'machin', 'learn', 'heldback', 'outdat', 'tool', 'system']",0.0,0.8639225363731384,0.05142805352807045,0.08438925445079803,0.0,1,manufactur; book; bsd; system; read; implement; new; technolog; oper; data,Topic: 1,The journey to modern manufacturing with AWS - All Things Distributed,27,69,-1.0359288,-4.1992183

modern industrial applications through MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

solve the challenge of liberating industrial data to extract insights
from it. Using the right tools Manufacturers that are struggling to modernize their factories or feel
overwhelmed about all the different investments they could make in new
technology should focus on getting to the data. Collect data from
on-premises equipment, historian databases, and IoT sensors and move it
to the cloud. Then it can be organized, analyzed, visualized, and,
eventually, used to do more advanced things, like train an ML model that
can help predict when machinery will need to be serviced, thereby
avoiding unplanned downtime for operations. While that might sound
easier said than done, there are a variety of solutions that can help. Let’s take a look at the journey to modern manufacturing and some of the
tools at AWS that can help along the way. Data ingestion One solution that’s become very important at AWS in simplifying the
ingestion of data into the cloud is AWS IoT
SiteWise, a managed service that
makes it easy to collect, store, organize, and monitor data from
industrial equipment at scale.  Figure 1: AWS IoT SiteWise process flow AWS IoT SiteWise includes edge gateway software that automates the
process of securely connecting to on-premises equipment, collecting and
organizing industrial equipment data, and sending the data to the cloud.
Manufacturers run this gateway software on popular third-party
industrial gateways to read data using OPC Unified Architecture
(OPC-UA). This is an open interoperability standard for secure and
reliable exchange of data within industrial automation developed by the
OPC Foundation. By using standards like OPC-UA, industrial customers have a consistent
method for interfacing with many types of industrial equipment, like
SCADA systems, PLCs, and historians on the factory floor. With this
information, manufacturers can compare machine 1 to machine 2 (which may
have been bought 15 years apart), production line 1 to production line
2, and even factory 1 to factory 2. AWS IoT SiteWise gateway software is provided as a pre-packaged
connector that runs on AWS IoT
Greengrass, which extends AWS to
edge devices so that they can act locally on the data they generate
while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable

With AWS IoT
SiteWise, customers model their industrial equipment, processes, and
facilities by adding context (like equipment type and facility location)
to the collected data and creating hierarchies to represent
relationships. Then they define common industrial performance metrics,
like Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and uptime, on top of the
data using the AWS IoT SiteWise built-in library of mathematical
functions. As data is ingested into the cloud, AWS IoT SiteWise automatically
computes the metrics at the interval defined by the customer (like
“report uptime every hour”). All uploaded data and computed metrics are
stored in a fully managed time series database, which automatically
scales with the customer’s data usage and storage. This type of data
store is uniquely designed to store and retrieve time-stamped data with
low latency, making it significantly easier for customers to analyze
equipment performance over time. For example, Bayer Crop
Science, one of the
largest agricultural companies in the world, is constantly striving to
optimize yield in their crop fields and reduce waste in their production
plants. A major challenge they have faced in doing this is making all
the data they collected useful because it was stuck in siloes. Now,
using AWS IoT SiteWise across multiple corn production plants, they can
combine and analyze this data in a meaningful way, like to measure the
OEE of their machinery in near real time to identify production
inefficiencies. Data Visualization Having the right tools to collect, organize, and create metrics on
incoming data without writing any code creates huge savings in time and
effort for any developer. But the data and insights gathered also need
to be easily shared and visualized by industrial end users, such as
process engineers and operators, who will use the information to
identify and apply corrective actions and process improvements. From within the AWS IoT SiteWise console, customers can create no-code,
fully managed web applications in minutes. There, they can display
equipment data and computed metrics in near real time and compare and
analyze historical performance across equipment or facilities. End users
can access the web applications from a browser on any web-enabled
desktop, tablet, or phone and sign-in with their corporate credentials
through a single sign-on (SSO) experience. Customers can create one or
more web applications to easily share access to industrial data with any
team in their organization to spot anomalies. This helps manufacturers
reduce waste, make faster decisions, and optimize their plant
performance.

path that can help manufacturers take advantage of new technology and
business opportunities, no matter where they are in their journey. I
look forward to seeing what our manufacturing customers will develop
next.  Machine learning and more The next step in the journey to modern manufacturing is to start using
ML for predictive maintenance. Many manufacturers rely on people to
perform routine diagnostic duties and preventative maintenance on fixed
schedules. ML can provide a more reliable approach to preventive
maintenance. ML models can help predict the likelihood of asset failure
using sensor data and optimize schedules for maintenance procedures.
This predictive maintenance can help lower maintenance costs and reduce
unscheduled downtime. For example, Georgia-Pacific is using ML to optimize paper towel
manufacturing. The Georgia-Pacific ML model can predict—based on the
quality of a parent paper towel roll—precisely how fast converting
lines should run to avoid tearing and to maximize production while still
maintaining the best quality. By reducing paper tears, Georgia-Pacific
has increased profits by millions of dollars for just one production
line. And there are at least 150 more lines that could benefit from
these optimized processes. Predictive maintenance requires ML models that are trained on large
amounts of data. This is why data ingestion and data management are
critical first steps to take before expanding into ML. It’s also why
many companies choose to create a data
lake,
a centralized repository where organizations can store all their
structured and unstructured data at any scale. A data lake is a powerful
foundation for ML and AI (artificial intelligence) because ML and AI
thrive on large, diverse datasets. An important tool many of our manufacturing customers use for ML,
including Georgia-Pacific, is Amazon
SageMaker, a fully managed service
that removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning
process to develop high quality models. Summary The history of manufacturing is a timeline of technology innovation.
Since the industrial revolution, manufacturers have been developing new
approaches to increasing quality, speed, safety, and efficiency while
lowering costs and waste. Now, as manufacturing innovation has moved to

                    ARTICLE                 LOG IN Cloud misconfigurations continue to cause major headaches for organisations – and a recent report from Palo Alto Networks has uncovered an identity and access management (IAM) flaw that could have been worth ‘millions.’ The finding appears in the security provider’s Cloud Threat Report 2H 2020. The disclosure (28 pages, PDF, email required) came about after the Unit 42 cloud threat intelligence team – the research arm of Palo Alto – was contacted by a customer requesting a test of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure defences. The customer ran ‘thousands’ of workloads and ‘hundreds of S3 buckets. The researchers found, within a week, two ‘critical’ IAM misconfigurations which “rippled through all the customer’s AWS accounts… either of which could be crippling for any organisation,” as the report put it. The first misconfiguration allowed the research team to access sensitive data within internal, non-public S3 buckets, while the second was over-privileged IAM roles assigned to non-administrator user accounts. It is worth noting that the age old issue of shared responsibility again rears its head. Palo Alto was keen to stress that AWS ‘tries its best’ to detect and alert users when an IAM trust policy is misconfigured.

 The cloud is becoming increasingly distributed, with container technologies allowing easy deployment of what had been cloud functionality to devices at the edge of the network. What began with function-as-a-service runtimes has now graduated to supporting PaaS tools and technologies, stretching the cloud platform from public hyperscale data centers down to low-cost devices running on your network. Microsoft has been talking about “the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge” for a long time now, with a focus on finding ways around the bandwidth crunch between data sources and data processing in cloud architectures. There’s a certain level of self-interest in this approach, with hyperscale data centers close to cheap power but a long way from metropolitan population densities and relatively cheap bandwidth. If power is cheap and data is expensive, then why not process it close to the source? At the heart of much of Microsoft’s cloud platform is its SQL Server database, now grown into a family of databases that work across public and private clouds; at desktop, data center, and hyperscale; and on both Windows and Linux. That family of databases has recently been joined by a new member: Azure SQL Edge. Designed for IoT (Internet of Things) and edge gateway scenarios on Intel and ARM hardware, it’s a small, containerized database that can operate both while connected and disconnected, providing a place to preprocess and stream data that can be developed remotely and delivered and managed from Azure. Like the rest of the SQL Server family, Azure SQL Edge is a relational database with nonrelational capabilities. You can use it for traditional table-based storage, or instead work with JSON documents, with graph content, or with time-series data. That combination ensures you can use it for many different roles, but with a focus on IoT applications. It’s built on the SQL Server engine so there’s no need to learn new skills; the same techniques and programming tools you use on larger SQL Server instances work just as well on Azure SQL Edge, with

34,35,Getting started with Azure SQL Edge | InfoWorld,https://www.infoworld.com/article/3585795/getting-started-with-azure-sql-edge.html,2020-10-14,"As the container is only 500MB, it’s possible to run Azure SQL Edge on smaller devices such as the 8GB Raspberry Pi 4, especially after recent firmware updates have allowed it to be booted off SSD rather than SD cards. SSD storage makes devices like the Pi faster and more reliable; relatively slow and cheap SD card storage is not designed to handle the write cycles of a modern database.  It’s important to remember that Azure SQL Edge is a variant of the Linux SQL Server release, and its container’s base operating system is Ubuntu 18.04. To get support, any host will need to run either 18.04 or 20.04 LTS releases of Ubuntu (so you can build and test applications on any Windows 10 PC running Windows Subsystem for Linux). You can use other Linux hosts or even the Windows version of Docker, but they won’t be tested and may not have all the services and applications needed to run your database. Once a container instance is up and running, you can connect to it using the built-in command line tools (if you’re not running on ARM64, which doesn’t currently support sqlcmd). From here you can create tables and test queries, much like any other SQL Server database. In practice, you’re more likely to work with it remotely, using your choice of management and development tools. You need to ensure that appropriate container ports are open as part of the initial configuration process to use external tools. Much of Azure SQL Edge is designed to support traditional database operations; there’s additional support for basic stream analytics to work with real-time data from devices. You can use this to build applications that filter data before uploading to a central processing application in Azure, or as a feed into machine-learning applications that work with models developed on Azure or development PCs and exported as ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange). You don’t need new tools to manage or develop for Azure SQL Edge.

35,36,Getting started with Azure SQL Edge | InfoWorld,https://www.infoworld.com/article/3585795/getting-started-with-azure-sql-edge.html,2020-10-14,"Even though the price for Azure SQL Edge is relatively low, you do need to compare it with open source alternatives that can interoperate with cloud databases. It has an advantage if you’re already building SQL Server applications as part of an IoT strategy, if you need to take some of their functionality to the edge in order to manage bandwidth costs, or if you need to operate in a partially connected mode, leaving edge hardware operating autonomously for much of the time.  Azure SQL Edge may be a variant of SQL Server, but you shouldn’t expect to be able to bring all your existing applications to the edge, at least not without some modifications. Azure SQL Edge is designed to run only a subset of the core SQL Server database services, so you won’t have access to other parts of the platform, like Analysis or Reporting Services or most of its Machine Learning tools. In practice that shouldn’t be too much of a problem, as those features work best either on interactive systems or with the horsepower necessary for building and training models with large data sets. Using ONNX for inferencing on the edge allows you to deliver pretrained models, ready to filter data or flag exceptions for further analysis. Although Azure SQL Edge can operate with a direct connection to Azure SQL instances in the cloud, it’s designed to function as a stand-alone database on disconnected, low-power systems. With that in mind, you should build applications that don’t rely on connected features such as stretch databases or memory-intensive tools like OLTP, as they’re not part of the Azure SQL Edge build. Licensing is relatively simple. There are two editions: one for production, one for development. The development SKU supports as many as four cores and 32GB of memory; the production version supports as many as eight cores and 64GB of memory. Those are relatively high specifications for edge hardware, but they’re what you’d expect from hub devices at the network edge. In practice, this hardware would collate and process data from multiple edge devices. Pricing starts at $10 per device per month, with reductions for one-year and three-year reserved instances that can bring it down to $60 per device per year.",even though the price for azure sql edge is relatively low you do need to compare it with open source alternatives that can interoperate with cloud databases. it has an advantage if youre already building sql server applications as part of an iot strategy if you need to take some of their functionality to the edge in order to manage bandwidth costs or if you need to operate in a partially connected mode leaving edge hardware operating autonomously for much of the time.  azure sql edge may be a variant of sql server but you shouldnt expect to be able to bring all your existing applications to the edge at least not without some modifications. azure sql edge is designed to run only a subset of the core sql server database services so you wont have access to other parts of the platform like analysis or reporting services or most of its machine learning tools. in practice that shouldnt be too much of a problem as those features work best either on interactive systems or with the horsepower necessary for building and training models with large data sets. using onnx for inferencing on the edge allows you to deliver pretrained models ready to filter data or flag exceptions for further analysis. although azure sql edge can operate with a direct connection to azure sql instances in the cloud its designed to function as a standalone database on disconnected lowpower systems. with that in mind you should build applications that dont rely on connected features such as stretch databases or memoryintensive tools like oltp as theyre not part of the azure sql edge build. licensing is relatively simple. there are two editions one for production one for development. the development sku supports as many as four cores and gb of memory the production version supports as many as eight cores and gb of memory. those are relatively high specifications for edge hardware but theyre what youd expect from hub devices at the network edge. in practice this hardware would collate and process data from multiple edge devices. pricing starts at  per device per month with reductions for oneyear and threeyear reserved instances that can bring it down to  per device per year.,14,0.013,0.926,0.061,0.961,22.40557861328125,"['even', 'though', 'price', 'azur', 'sql', 'edg', 'relat', 'low', 'need', 'compar', 'open', 'sourc', 'altern', 'interoper', 'cloud', 'databas', 'advantag', 'your', 'alreadi', 'build', 'sql', 'server', 'applic', 'part', 'iot', 'strategi', 'need', 'take', 'function', 'edg', 'order', 'manag', 'bandwidth', 'cost', 'need', 'oper', 'partial', 'connect', 'mode', 'leav', 'edg', 'hardwar', 'oper', 'autonom', 'much', 'time', 'azur', 'sql', 'edg', 'may', 'variant', 'sql', 'server', 'shouldnt', 'expect', 'abl', 'bring', 'exist', 'applic', 'edg', 'least', 'without', 'modif', 'azur', 'sql', 'edg', 'design', 'run', 'subset', 'core', 'sql', 'server', 'databas', 'servic', 'wont', 'access', 'part', 'platform', 'analysi', 'report', 'servic', 'machin', 'learn', 'tool', 'practic', 'shouldnt', 'much', 'problem', 'featur', 'work', 'best', 'either', 'interact', 'system', 'horsepow', 'necessari', 'build', 'train', 'model', 'larg', 'data', 'set', 'use', 'onnx', 'inferenc', 'edg', 'allow', 'deliv', 'pretrain', 'model', 'readi', 'filter', 'data', 'flag', 'except', 'analysi', 'although', 'azur', 'sql', 'edg', 'oper', 'direct', 'connect', 'azur', 'sql', 'instanc', 'cloud', 'design', 'function', 'standalon', 'databas', 'disconnect', 'lowpow', 'system', 'mind', 'build', 'applic', 'reli', 'connect', 'featur', 'stretch', 'databas', 'memoryintens', 'tool', 'oltp', 'theyr', 'part', 'azur', 'sql', 'edg', 'build', 'licens', 'relat', 'simpl', 'edit', 'product', 'develop', 'develop', 'sku', 'support', 'mani', 'four', 'core', 'memori', 'product', 'version', 'support', 'mani', 'eight', 'core', 'memori', 'relat', 'high', 'specif', 'edg', 'hardwar', 'theyr', 'youd', 'expect', 'hub', 'devic', 'network', 'edg', 'practic', 'hardwar', 'collat', 'process', 'data', 'multipl', 'edg', 'devic', 'price', 'start', 'per', 'devic', 'per', 'month', 'reduct', 'oneyear', 'threeyear', 'reserv', 'instanc', 'bring', 'per', 'devic', 'per', 'year']",0.0,0.0,0.8357563018798828,0.16391180455684662,0.0,2,data; cloud; lake; team; amazon; need; work; busi; time; data_lake,Topic: 2,Getting started with Azure SQL Edge | InfoWorld,36,47,22.008568,8.653077

 Semantics. You can’t get away from them. Any good argument worth having is full of nuance, articulated largely through differences in definitions. When there is no disagreement, like “alternative facts aren’t facts”, semantics don’t matter, because we all know it is just spin. Real discussion comes through exploring the nuance in semantic differences. That is where our story starts. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) simply doesn’t give us what we need to understand where cloud is going in the future. A new phrase, coined by Lew Tucker and James Urquhart, needs to be brought into stark relief: Services-as-a-Platform (SaaP). In this article I want to go into much more detail about what Lew and James were talking about. You need to understand it, because not only does it directly affect public cloud adoption, but it inherently affects private cloud strategy within the enterprise. My definition of PaaS has been consistent from the beginning of this cloud journey more than 10 years ago: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): A “load your code and go” system for developers What I mean by this is that developers want to develop within a relatively constrained framework, in a relatively deterministic manner, and push code from environment to environment by simply referring to a particular commit in a source code repository. Examples of this are CloudFoundry, OpenShift, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. SaaP is quite a bit different. My working definition is as follows: Services-as-a-Platform (SaaP): Composable, reusable services optimized for DevOps, managed via API, and meant to be assembled into a customized PaaS that is application specific by DevOps teams Examples of the services that would be part of a SaaP include RDBMS, NoSQL, messaging/queuing, speech2text, MapReduce, DNS, and directory services. None of these services are strictly part of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Nor are they, by themselves, part of PaaS, although they are frequently a subset of PaaS.",the key difference between paas and saap is that a paas is more like a constrained system whereas saap can be consumed a la carte. another difference is that unlike a paas elements of saap may be used individually as a service that supports no specific application. in fact in this case a saap isnt even specific to developers. it could be used by infrastructure operators individuals or even business folks. a good example of this is aws route dnsasaservice.  posted on jul   by randy bias semantics. you cant get away from them. any good argument worth having is full of nuance articulated largely through differences in definitions. when there is no disagreement like alternative facts arent facts semantics dont matter because we all know it is just spin. real discussion comes through exploring the nuance in semantic differences. that is where our story starts. platformasaservice paas simply doesnt give us what we need to understand where cloud is going in the future. a new phrase coined by lew tucker and james urquhart needs to be brought into stark relief servicesasaplatform saap. in this article i want to go into much more detail about what lew and james were talking about. you need to understand it because not only does it directly affect public cloud adoption but it inherently affects private cloud strategy within the enterprise. my definition of paas has been consistent from the beginning of this cloud journey more than  years ago platformasaservice paas a load your code and go system for developers what i mean by this is that developers want to develop within a relatively constrained framework in a relatively deterministic manner and push code from environment to environment by simply referring to a particular commit in a source code repository. examples of this are cloudfoundry openshift and aws elastic beanstalk. saap is quite a bit different. my working definition is as follows servicesasaplatform saap composable reusable services optimized for devops managed via api and meant to be assembled into a customized paas that is application specific by devops teams examples of the services that would be part of a saap include rdbms nosql messagingqueuing speechtext mapreduce dns and directory services. none of these services are strictly part of infrastructureasaservice iaas. nor are they by themselves part of paas although they are frequently a subset of paas.,21,0.032,0.911,0.058,0.8764,18.98754119873047,"['key', 'differ', 'paa', 'saap', 'paa', 'constrain', 'system', 'wherea', 'saap', 'consum', 'cart', 'anoth', 'differ', 'unlik', 'paa', 'element', 'saap', 'may', 'use', 'individu', 'servic', 'support', 'specif', 'applic', 'fact', 'case', 'saap', 'isnt', 'even', 'specif', 'develop', 'could', 'use', 'infrastructur', 'oper', 'individu', 'even', 'busi', 'folk', 'good', 'exampl', 'rout', 'dnsasaservic', 'post', 'jul', 'randi', 'bias', 'semant', 'cant', 'away', 'good', 'argument', 'worth', 'full', 'nuanc', 'articul', 'larg', 'differ', 'definit', 'disagr', 'altern', 'fact', 'arent', 'fact', 'semant', 'matter', 'know', 'spin', 'real', 'discus', 'come', 'explor', 'nuanc', 'semant', 'differ', 'stori', 'start', 'platformasaservic', 'paa', 'simpli', 'doesnt', 'give', 'need', 'understand', 'cloud', 'futur', 'new', 'phrase', 'coin', 'lew', 'tucker', 'jame', 'urquhart', 'need', 'brought', 'stark', 'relief', 'servicesasaplatform', 'saap', 'want', 'much', 'detail', 'lew', 'jame', 'talk', 'need', 'understand', 'direct', 'affect', 'public', 'cloud', 'adopt', 'inher', 'affect', 'privat', 'cloud', 'strategi', 'within', 'enterpris', 'definit', 'paa', 'consist', 'begin', 'cloud', 'journey', 'year', 'ago', 'platformasaservic', 'paa', 'load', 'code', 'system', 'develop', 'mean', 'develop', 'want', 'develop', 'within', 'relat', 'constrain', 'framework', 'relat', 'determinist', 'manner', 'push', 'code', 'environ', 'environ', 'simpli', 'refer', 'particular', 'commit', 'sourc', 'code', 'repositori', 'exampl', 'cloudfoundri', 'openshift', 'elast', 'beanstalk', 'saap', 'quit', 'bit', 'differ', 'work', 'definit', 'follow', 'servicesasaplatform', 'saap', 'compos', 'reusabl', 'servic', 'optim', 'devop', 'manag', 'via', 'api', 'meant', 'assembl', 'custom', 'paa', 'applic', 'specif', 'devop', 'team', 'exampl', 'servic', 'part', 'saap', 'includ', 'rdbms', 'nosql', 'messagingqueu', 'speechtext', 'mapreduc', 'dns', 'directori', 'servic', 'none', 'servic', 'strict', 'part', 'infrastructureasaservic', 'iaa', 'part', 'paa', 'although', 'frequent', 'subset', 'paa']",0.0,0.0,0.999354898929596,0.0,0.0,2,data; cloud; lake; team; amazon; need; work; busi; time; data_lake,Topic: 2,*aaS Backwards: Services as a Platform | Cloudscaling ,37,54,7.9344363,-4.825326

The following table is an attempt to sum up these differences. The term “platform” can be overused and underspecified. Examples include Microsoft operating systems and their code development environments (.NET), the Android and iOS systems, and Java and its ecosystem. Let’s take .NET as our example. If you develop to the .NET framework and its ecosystem, you get a tremendous amount of leverage as a developer. Many of the nuts and bolts of what you need to write your code, such as performing DNS lookups, accessing databases, looking up information in directory services, just works out of the box. But, if you don’t like the way that these capabilities are provided to you it can be extremely difficult to swap them out. And it can be completely onerous to write your own. So, you develop within a constrained framework, knowing that you get a certain amount of leverage and acceleration by using the built-in capabilities and services. This is what leveraging a platform means to a developer. This is why PaaS is defined as above. Platforms constrain choice. That’s an inherent aspect of what building a platform means, and it’s integral to the value proposition of a platform. SaaP is very different. It is inherently about offering choice: “Here, developer, is a smorgasbord of services that may be helpful in supporting your application. Use one, some, or none.

 It’s 9:00 AM on a Wednesday. You’re in the boardroom giving a status update on the latest migration project that will remove most of the vulnerabilities found during the recent pandemic. This is the third migration project, all less than 100 workloads and 10 data sets. All have taken place in parallel, and all leverage different cloud migration teams. Company leadership notes that the metrics were very different between the projects. Project One shows nearly 80 percent efficiency in terms of code refactoring, testing, deployment, security implementation, etc. The others were closer to 30 and 40 percent. Why the differences?  Most efficiency issues arise from dynamic versus static migration approaches and tools. Most people who currently do cloud migrations gravitate toward the specific processes, approaches, and migration tool suites that worked for past projects. This static approach to cloud migration forces a specific set of processes and tools onto a wide variety of migration projects and problem domains. The misuse of specific processes and tools as generic solutions often leads to failure. ",core to this issue is our drive to find a specific suite of tools and technology bundles that the industry considers bestofbreed and our desire to leverage best practices. we in it love to follow the crowd i read about these tools and this approach that worked for joe and jane and bob at companies kind of like mine so theyll work for me too. we make the erroneous assumption that we remove risk by not making our own choices even if the choices are situational.  by david linthicum infoworld its  am on a wednesday. youre in the boardroom giving a status update on the latest migration project that will remove most of the vulnerabilities found during the recent pandemic. this is the third migration project all less than  workloads and  data sets. all have taken place in parallel and all leverage different cloud migration teams. company leadership notes that the metrics were very different between the projects. project one shows nearly  percent efficiency in terms of code refactoring testing deployment security implementation etc. the others were closer to  and  percent. why the differences most efficiency issues arise from dynamic versus static migration approaches and tools. most people who currently do cloud migrations gravitate toward the specific processes approaches and migration tool suites that worked for past projects. this static approach to cloud migration forces a specific set of processes and tools onto a wide variety of migration projects and problem domains. the misuse of specific processes and tools as generic solutions often leads to failure.,15,0.046,0.854,0.1,0.928,23.675281524658203,"['core', 'issu', 'drive', 'find', 'specif', 'suit', 'tool', 'technolog', 'bundl', 'industri', 'consid', 'bestofbre', 'desir', 'leverag', 'best', 'practic', 'love', 'follow', 'crowd', 'read', 'tool', 'approach', 'work', 'joe', 'jane', 'bob', 'compani', 'kind', 'mine', 'theyll', 'work', 'erron', 'assumpt', 'remov', 'risk', 'make', 'choic', 'even', 'choic', 'situat', 'david', 'linthicum', 'infoworld', 'wednesday', 'your', 'boardroom', 'give', 'status', 'updat', 'latest', 'migrat', 'project', 'remov', 'vulner', 'found', 'recent', 'pandem', 'third', 'migrat', 'project', 'le', 'workload', 'data', 'set', 'taken', 'place', 'parallel', 'leverag', 'differ', 'cloud', 'migrat', 'team', 'compani', 'leadership', 'note', 'metric', 'differ', 'project', 'project', 'show', 'near', 'percent', 'effici', 'term', 'code', 'refactor', 'test', 'deploy', 'secur', 'implement', 'etc', 'other', 'closer', 'percent', 'differ', 'effici', 'issu', 'aris', 'dynam', 'versus', 'static', 'migrat', 'approach', 'tool', 'peopl', 'current', 'cloud', 'migrat', 'gravit', 'toward', 'specif', 'process', 'approach', 'migrat', 'tool', 'suit', 'work', 'past', 'project', 'static', 'approach', 'cloud', 'migrat', 'forc', 'specif', 'set', 'process', 'tool', 'onto', 'wide', 'varieti', 'migrat', 'project', 'problem', 'domain', 'misus', 'specif', 'process', 'tool', 'generic', 'solut', 'often', 'lead', 'failur']",0.0,0.18426324427127838,0.8149946928024292,0.0,0.0,2,data; cloud; lake; team; amazon; need; work; busi; time; data_lake,Topic: 2,Static versus dynamic cloud migration  | InfoWorld,54,50,8.22072,8.610842

To take advantage of these exceptions, there needs to be centralized command and control of all migrations, such as a center of excellence where problem patterns and solutions during each migration project can be documented. With centralized command and control (CCC), your own best practices will emerge, and they will have a much higher likelihood of working in future migration projects.   As an expert in this field, I would love to list a standard set of migration tools that will address everyone’s needs—code scanners, configuration management, continuous integration and development, testing tools, and more. But the real answer is that your selections of tools and approaches must be based on the requirements of the applications and databases you are migrating to public clouds--or any other platform, for that matter.  The project criteria and review processes for migration projects typically include, but are not limited to: The tool categories listed above will have different solutions based on the “as is” and “to be” platforms, development approaches, and databases used, as well as the identified storage, security, and governance requirements. Although a one-size-fits-all approach might work, it will rarely provide the promised efficiencies and could actually derail the entire project if the approaches and tools are too far off.  My message here is that you need an extra step in the process. Select the tools and approaches based on what you want to move, where it needs to go, and the attributes it needs to have upon arrival.

In addition to shrugging away potential risks, humans also tend to avoid situations that make them fearful or uncomfortable. On a personal level this is called procrastination, but on a corporate and strategic level, proactive change may be suppressed due to financial concerns, or potential damage to a reputation.

The next BriefingsDirect agile business enablement discussion explores how a portfolio approach to standards has emerged as a key way to grapple with digital transformation. As businesses seek to make agility a key differentiator in a rapidly changing world, applying enterprise architecture (EA) in concert with many other standards has never been more powerful. Stay with us here to explore how to define and corral a comprehensive standards resources approach for making businesses intrinsically agile and competitive.  Listen to the podcast. Find it on iTunes. Read a full transcript or download a copy.  To learn more about attaining agility via an embrace of a broad toolkit of standards, we are joined by our panel, Chris Frost, Principal Enterprise Architect and Distinguished Engineer, Application Technology Consulting Division, at Fujitsu; Sonia Gonzalez, The Open Group TOGAF® Product Manager, and Paul Homan, Distinguished Engineer and Chief Technology Officer, Industrial, at IBM Services. The discussion is moderated by Dana Gardner, Principal Analyst at Interarbor Solutions.   Gardner: Sonia, why is it critical to modernize businesses in a more comprehensive and structured fashion? How do standards help best compete in this digital-intensive era? Gonzalez: The question is more important than ever. We need to be very quickly responding to changes in the market. The current situation with COVID-19 has made for a very unpredictable environment. So we need to be faster in the ways we respond. We need to make better use of our resources and to be able to innovate in how we offer our products and services. And since everybody else is also doing that, we must be agile and respond quickly.  Gardner: Chris, how are things different now than a year ago? Is speed all that we’re dealing with when it comes to agility? Or is there something more to it? Frost: Speed is clearly a very important part of it, and market trends are driving that need for speed and agility. But this has been building for a lot more than a year. We now have, with some of the hyperscale cloud providers, the capability to deploy new systems and new business processes more quickly than ever before. And with some of the new technologies -- like artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and 5G – there are new technological innovations that enable us to do things that we couldn’t do before. A combination of these things has come together in the last few years that has produced a unique need now for speed. That’s what I seek in the market, Dana. Gardner: Paul, when it comes to manufacturing and industrial organizations, how do things change for them in particular? Is there something about the data, the complexity? Why are standards more important than ever in certain verticals? There are still so many more things that need to be integrated, and fundamentally EA comes back to the how – how do you integrate all of these things? A great deal of the connectivity we’re now seeing around the world needs a higher level of integration. Gardner: Sonia, to follow this point on broader integration, does applying standards across different parts of any organization now make more sense than in the past? Why does one part of the business need to be in concert with the others? And how does The Open Group portfolio help produce a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to integration? Gonzalez: Yes, what Paul mentioned about being able to integrate and interconnect is paramount for us. Our portfolio of standards, which is more than just [The Open Group Architectural Forum (TOGAF®)]  Standard, is like having a toolkit of different open standards that you can use to address different needs, depending upon your particular situation. For example, there may be cases in which we need to build physical products across an extended industrial environment. In that case, certain kinds of standards will apply. Also critical is how the different standards will be used together and pursue interoperability. Therefore, borderless information flow is one of our trademarks at The Open Group. Other more intangible cases, such as digital services, need standards. For example, the Digital Practitioner Body of Knowledge (DPBoK™) supports a scale model to support the digital enterprise. Other standards are coming around agile enterprises and best practices. They support how to make interconnections and interoperability faster -- but at the same time having the proper consistency and integration to align with the overall strategy. At the end of the day, it’s not enough to integrate for just a technical point of view. You need bring new value to your businesses. You need to be aligned with your business model, and with your business view, to your strategy.
 So, therefore, we have different standards that cover all of those different areas. As I said at the beginning, these form a toolkit with which you can choose different standards and make them work together conforming a portfolio of standards. Gardner: So, whether we look to standards individually or together as a toolkit, it’s important that they have a real-world applicability and benefits. I’m curious, Paul and Chris, what’s holding organizations back from using more standards to help them? Homan: When we use the term traditional enterprise architecture, it always needs to be adapted to suit the environment and the context. TOGAF, for example, has to be tailored to the organization and for the individual assignment. But I’ve been around in the industry long enough to be familiar with a number of what I call anti-patterns that have grown up around EA practices and which are not helping with the need for agility. This comes from the idea that EA has heavy governance. We have all witnessed such core practices -- and I will confess to having being part of some of them. And these obviously fly in the face of the agility, flexibility, of being able to push decisions out to the edge and pivot quickly, and to make mistakes and be allowed to learn from them. So kind of an experimental attitude. And so gaining such adaptation is more than just promoting good architectural decision-making within a set of guide rails -- it allows decision-making to happen at the point of need. So that’s the needed adaption that I see.  Gardner: Chris, what challenges do you see organizations dealing with, and why are standards be so important to helping them attain a higher level of agility? Frost: The standards are important, not so much because they are a standard but because they represent industry best practices. The way standards are developed in The Open Group are not some sort of theoretical exercise. It’s very much member-driven and brought together by the members drawing on their practical experiences. Coming back to what Paul said, there is a certain historical perspective here that we have to acknowledge. EA projects in the past -- and certainly things I have been personally involved in -- were often delivered in a very waterfall fashion. That created a certain perception that somehow EA means big-design-upfront-waterfall-style projects -- and that absolutely isn’t the case. That is one of the reasons why a certain adaptation is needed. Guidance about how to adapt is needed. The word adapt is very important because it’s not as if all of the knowledge and fundamental techniques that we have learned over the past few years are being thrown away. It’s a question of how we adapt to agile delivery, and the things we have been doing recently in The Open Group demonstrate exactly how to do that. Gardner: And does this concept of a minimum viable architecture fit in to that? Does that help people move past the notion of the older waterfall structure to EA? Frost: Yes, very much it does. It’s something that you might regard as reaching first base. In architectural terms, that minimum viable architecture is like reaching first base, and that emphasizes a notion of rapidly getting to something that you can take forward to the next stage. You can get feedback and also an acknowledgment that you will improve and iterate in the future. Those are fundamental about agile working. So, yes, that minimum viable architecture concept is a really important one.  Gardner: Sonia,
 if we are thinking about a minimum viable architecture we are probably 
also working toward a maximum value standards portfolio. How do 
standards like TOGAF work in concert with other open standards, 
standards not in The Open Group? How do we get to that maximum value 
when it comes to a portfolio of standards?  Gonzalez: That’s very important. First, it has to do with adapting the practice, and not only the standard. In order to face new challenges, especially ones with agile and digital, the practices need to evolve and therefore, the standards – including the whole portfolio of The Open Group standards which are constantly in evolution and improvement. Our members are the ones contributing with the content that follows the new trends, best practices, and uses for all of those practices. The standards need to evolve to cover areas like digital and agile. And with the concept of minimal viable architecture, the standards are evolving to provide guidance on how EA as a practice supports agile. Actually, nothing in the standard says it has to be used in the waterfall way, even though some people may say that. TOGAF is now building guidance for how people can use the standards supporting the agile enterprise, delivering that in an agile way, and also supporting an agile approach, which is having a different view of how the practice is applied following this new shift and this new adaption. The practice needs to be adapted, the standards need to evolve to fulfill that, and need to be applied to specific situations. For example, it’s not the same to architect organizations in which you have ground processes, especially in a back office than other ones that are more customer facing. For the first ones, their processes are heavier, they don’t need to be that agile. That agile architecture is for upfront customers that need to support a faster pace. So, you might have cases in which you need to mix different ways to apply the practices and standards. Less agile approach for the back office and a more agile approach for customer facing applications such as, for example, online banking. Adaptation also depends on the nature of companies. The healthcare industry is one example. We cannot experiment that much in that area because that’s more risk assessment and less subject to experimentation. For these kinds of organizations a different approach is needed.
 

There is work in progress in different sectors. For example, we have a 
very good guide and case study about how to use the TOGAF standard along
 with the ArchiMate® modeling notation in the banking industry using the BIAN®  Reference Model.
 That’s a very good use case in The Open Group library. We also have a 
work in progress in the forum around how governments architect. The IndEA Reference Model is another example of a reference model for that government and has been put together based on open standards. ",we also have work in progress around security such as with thesabsaframework for business security architecture for example. we have developed guidance about standards and security along with sabsa. we also have a partnership with theobject management group omg in which we are pioneers and have a liaison to build products that will go to market to help practitioners use external standards along

are not helping with the need for agility. this comes from the idea that ea has heavy governance. we have all witnessed such core practices  and i will confess to having being part of some of them. and these obviously fly in the face of the agility flexibility of being able to push decisions out to the edge and pivot quickly and to make mistakes and be allowed to learn from them. so kind of an experimental attitude. and so gaining such adaptation is more than just promoting good architectural decisionmaking within a set of guide rails  it allows decisionmaking to happen at the point of need. so thats the needed adaption that i see. gardnerchris what challenges do you see organizations dealing with and why are standards be so important to helping them attain a higher level of agility frostthe standards are important not so much because they are a standard but because they represent industry best practices. the way standards are developed in the open group are not some sort of theoretical exercise. its very much memberdriven and brought together by the members drawing on their practical experiences. coming back to what paul said there is a certain historical perspective here that we have to acknowledge. ea projects in the past  and certainly things i have been personally involved in  were often delivered in a very waterfall fashion. that created a certain perception that somehow ea means bigdesignupfrontwaterfallstyle projects  and that absolutely isnt the case. that is one of the reasons why a certain adaptation is needed. guidance about how to adapt is needed. the word adaptis very important because its not as if all of the knowledge and fundamental techniques that we have learned over the past few years are being thrown away. its a question of how we adapt to agile delivery and the things we have been doing recently in the open group demonstrate exactly how to do that. gardnerand does this concept of aminimum viable architecturefit in to that does that help people move past the notion of the older waterfall structure to ea frostyes very much it does. its something that you might regard as reaching first base. in architectural terms that minimum viable architecture is like reaching first base and that emphasizes a notion of rapidly getting to something that you can take forward to the next stage. you can get feedback and also an acknowledgment that you will improve and iterate in the future. those are fundamental about agile working. so yes that minimum viable architecture concept is a really important one. gardnersonia if we are thinking about a minimum viable architecture we are probably also working toward a maximum value standards portfolio. how do standards like togaf work in concert with other open standards standards not in the open group how do we get to that maximum value when it comes to a portfolio of standards  gonzalezthats very important. first it has to do with adapting the practice and not only the standard. in order to face new challenges especially ones with agile and digital the practices need to evolve and therefore the standards  including the whole portfolio of the open group standards which are constantly in evolution and improvement. our members are the ones contributing with the content that follows the new trends best practices and uses for all of those practices. the standards need to evolve to cover areas like digital and agile. and with the concept of minimal viable architecture the standards are evolving to provide guidance on how ea as a practice supports agile. actually nothing in the standard says it has to be used in the waterfall way even though some people may say that. togaf is now building guidance for how people can use the standards supporting the agile enterprise delivering that in an agile way and also supporting an agile approach which is having a different view of how the practice is applied following this new shift and this new adaption. the practice needs to be adapted the standards need to evolve to fulfill that and need to be applied to specific situations. for example its not the same to architect organizations in which you have ground processes especially in a back office than other ones that are more customer facing. for the first ones their processes are heavier they dont need to be that agile. that agile architecture is for upfront customers that need to support a faster pace. so you might have cases in which you need to mix different ways to apply the practices and standards. less agile approach for the back office and a more agile approach for customer facing applications such as for example online banking. adaptation also depends on the nature of companies. the healthcare industry is one example. we cannot experiment that much in that area because thats more risk assessment and less subject to experimentation. for these kinds of organizations a different approach is needed. there is work in progress in different sectors. for example we have a very good guide and case study about how to use the togaf standard along with thearchimate modeling notationin the banking industry using thebian reference model. thats a very good use case in the open group library. we also have a work in progress in the forum around how governments architect. theindea reference modelis another example of a reference model for that government and has been put together based on open standards. ,107,0.009,0.884,0.108,0.9995,21.50883674621582,"['work', 'progress', 'around', 'secur', 'thesabsaframework', 'busi',

60,61,Dana Gardner's BriefingsDirect,https://www.briefingsdirectblog.com/,2020-10-05,"Gonzalez: Things are evolving rapidly. In order to be agile and a digital enterprise there are different things that need to change around the organization. It’s a business issue, it’s not something related to only platforms of technology, or technology adoption. It’s going ahead of that to the business models.  Gardner: When we look at standards as promoting greater business agility, there might be people who look to the past and say, “Well, yes, but it was associated with a structured waterfall approach for so long.” But what happens if you don’t have architecture and you try to be agile? What’s the downside if you don’t have enough structure; you don’t put in these best practices? What can happen if you try to be agile without a necessary amount of architectural integrity? Homan: I’m glad that you asked, because I have a number of organizations that I have worked with that have experienced the results of diminishing their architectural governance. I won’t name who they are for obvious reasons, but I know of organizations that have embraced agility. They had great responses to being able to do things quickly, find things out, move fleet-of-foot, and then combined with that cloud computing capabilities. They had great freedom to exercise where they choose to source commodity cloud services. And, as an enterprise architect, if I look in, that freedom created a massive amount of mini-silos. As soon as those need to come together and scale -- and scale is the big word -- that’s where the problems started. I’ve seen, for example, around common use of information and standards, processes and workflows that don’t cross between one cloud vendor and another. And these are end-customer-facing services and deliveries that frankly clash from the same organization, from the same brand. And those sorts of things came about because they weren’t using common reference architectures. There wasn’t a common understanding of the value propositions that were being worked toward, and they manifested because you could rapidly spin stuff out.
 

When you have a small, agile model of everybody co-located in a 
relatively contained space -- where they can readily connect and 
communicate -- great. But unfortunately as soon as you go and disperse 
the model, have a round of additional development, distribute to more 
geographies and markets, with lots of different products, you behave 
like a large organization. It’s inevitable that people are going to 
plough their own furrow and go in different directions. And so, you need
 to have a way of bringing it back together again. And that’s typically where people come in and start asking how to reintegrate. They love the freedom and we want to keep the freedom, but they need to combine that with a way of having some gentle guardrails that allow them to exercise freedom of speed but not diverge too much. Frost: The word guardrails is really important because that is very much the emphasis of how agile architectures need to work. My observation is that, without some amount of architecture and planning, what tends to go wrong is some of the foundational things – such as using common descriptions of data or common underlying platforms. If you don’t get those right, different aspects of an overall solution can diverge and fail to integrate.    A really important judgment point is what’s just enough architecture upfront to set down those important guardrails without going too far and going back into the big design upfront approach, which we want to avoid to still create the most freedom that we can. Gardner: Sonia, a big part of the COVID-19 response has been rapidly reorganizing or refactoring supply chains. This requires extended enterprise cooperation and ultimately integration. How are standards like TOGAF and the toolkit from The Open Group important to allow organizations to enjoy agility across organizational boundaries, perhaps under dire circumstances? Gonzalez: That is precisely when more architecture is needed, because you need to be able to put together a landscape, a whole view of your organization, which is now a standard organization. Your partners, customers, customer alliances, all of your liaisons, are a part of your value chain and you need to have visibility over this. You mentioned suppliers and providers. These are changing due to the current situation. The way they work, everything is going more digital and virtual, with less face-to-face. So we need to change processes. We need to change value streams. And we need to be sure that we have the right capabilities. Having standards, it’s spot-on, because one of the advantages of having standards, and open standards especially, is that you facilitate communication with other parties. If you are talking the same language it will be easier to integrate and get people together. For example, you may need to deliver more digital capabilities to work virtually. You may need to change your whole process view to become more efficient and allow such remote work, and to do that you use standards. In the TOGAF standard we have a set of very good guidance for our business architecture, business models, business capabilities, and value streams; all of them are providing guidance on how to do that. Another very good guide under the TOGAF standard umbrella for their organization is called Organization Map Guide. It’s much more than having a formal organizational chart to your company. It’s how you map to different resources to respond quickly to changes in your landscape. So, having a more dynamic view, having a cross-coding view of your working teams, is required to be agile and to have interdisciplinary teams work together. So you need to have architecture, and you need to have open standards to address those challenges. Gardner: And, of course, The Open Group is not standing still, along with many other organizations, in trying to react to the environment and help organizations become more digital and enhance their customer and end-user experiences. What are some of the latest developments at The Open Group? Gonzalez: First, we are evolving our standards constantly. The TOGAF standard is evolving to address more of these agile-digital trends, how to adopt new technology trends in a way that they will be adopted in accord with your business model for your strategy and organizational culture. That’s an improvement that is coming. Also, the structure of the standard has evolved to be easier to use and more agile. It has been designed to evolve through new and improved versions more frequently than in the past. We also have other components coming into the portfolio. One of them is the Agile Architecture Standard, which is going to be released soon. That one is going straight into the agile space. It’s proposing a holistic view of the organization. This coupling between agile and digital is addressed in that standard. It is also suitable to be used along with the TOGAF standard. Both complement each other. The DPBoK is also evolving to address new trends in the market. We also have other standards. The Microservice Architecture is a very active working group that is delivering guidance on microservices delivered using the TOGAF standard. Another important one is the Zero Trust Architecturein the security space. Now more than ever, as we go virtual and rely on platforms, we need to be sure that we are having proper consistency in security and compliance. We have, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) considerations, which are stronger than ever. Those kinds of security breaches are addressed in that specific context. The IT4IT standard, which is another reference architecture, is evolving toward becoming more oriented to a digital product concept to precisely address all of those changes.
 

All of these standards, all the pieces, are moving together. There are 
other things coming, for example, delivering standards to serve specific
 areas like oil, gas, and electricity, which are more facility-oriented,
 more physically-oriented. We are also working toward those to be sure 
that we are addressing all of the different possibilities.  Another very important thing here is we are aiming for every standard we deliver into the market to have a certification program along with it. We have that for the TOGAF standard, ArchiMate standard, IT4IT, and DPBoK. So the idea is to continue increasing our portfolio of certification along with the portfolio of standards. Furthermore, we have more credentials as part of the TOGAF certification to allow people to go into specializations. For example, I’m TOGAF-certified but I also wanted to go for a Solution Architect Practitioner or a Digital Architect. So, we are combining the different products that we have, different standards, to have these building blocks we’re putting together for this learning curve around certifications, which is an important part of our offering. Gardner: I think it’s important to illustrate where these standards are put to work and how organizations find the right balance between a minimum viable architecture and a maximum value portfolio for agility. So let’s go through our panel for some examples. Are there organizations you are working with that come to mind that have found and struck the right balance? Are they using a portfolio to gain agility and integration across organizational boundaries? Homan: The key part for me is do these resources help people do architecture? And in some of the organizations I’ve worked with, some of the greatest successes have been where they have been able to pick and choose – cherry pick, if you like -- bits of different things and create a toolkit. It’s not about following just one thing. It’s about having a kit. The reason I mentioned that is because one of the examples I want to reference has to do with development of ecosystems. In ecosystems, it’s about how organizations work with each other to deliver some kind of customer-centric propositions. I’ve seen this in the construction industry in particular, where lots of organizations historically have had to come together to undertake large construction efforts. So that’s one industry that always had ecosystems, but IT has come in and therefore architects have had to better collaborate and find ways to integrate beyond the boundary of their organization, coming back to the whole mission of boundaryless information flow, if you will. Gardner: Chris, any examples that put a spotlight on some of the best uses of standards and the best applicability of them particularly for fostering agility? Frost: Yes, a number of customers in both the private and public sector are going through this transition to using agile processes. Some have been there for quite some time; some are just starting on that journey. We shouldn’t be surprised by this in the public and private sectors because everybody is reacting to the same market fundamentals driving the need for agile delivery. We’ve certainly worked with a few customers that have been very much at the forefront of developing new agile practices and how that integrates with EA and benefits from all of the good architectural skills and experiences that are in frameworks like the TOGAF standard. Paul talked about developing ecosystems. We’ve seen things such as organizations embarking on large-scale internal re-engineering where they are adjusting their own internal IT portfolios to react to the changing marketplace that they are confronted by. I am seeing a lot of common problems about fitting together agile techniques and architecture and needing to work in these iterative styles. But overwhelmingly, these problems are being solved. We are seeing the benefits of this iterative way of working with rapid feedback and the more rapid response to changing market techniques. I would say even inside The Open Group we’re seeing some of the effects of that. We’ve been talking about the development of some of the agile guidance for the TOGAF standard within The Open Group, and even within the working group itself we’ve seen adaption of more agile styles of working using some of the tools that are common in agile activities. Things like GitLab and Slack and these sorts of things. So it really is quite a pervasive thing we are seeing in the marketplace. Gardner: Sonia, are there any examples that come to mind that illustrate where organizations will be in the coming few years when it comes to the right intersection of agile, architecture, and the use of open standard? Any early adopters, if you will, or trendsetters that come to mind that illustrate where we should be expecting more organizations to be in the near future?",gonzalezthings are evolving rapidly. in

technology adoption. its going ahead of that to the business models.  gardnerwhen we look at standards as promoting greater business agility there might be people who look to the past and say well yes

of very good guidance for our business architecture business models business capabilities and value streams all of them are providing guidance on how to do that. another very good guide under the togaf standard umbrella for their organization is calledorganization map guide. its much more than having a formal organizational chart to your company. its how you map to different resources to respond quickly to changes in your landscape. so having a more dynamic view having a crosscoding view of your working teams is required to be agile and to have interdisciplinary teams work together. so you need to have architecture and you need to have open standards to address those challenges. gardnerand of course the open group is not standing still along with many other organizations in trying to react to the environment and help organizations become more digital and enhance their customer and enduser experiences. what are some of the latest developments at the open group gonzalezfirst we are evolving our standards constantly. the togaf standard is evolving to address more of these agiledigital trends how to adopt new technology trends in a way that they will be adopted in accord with your business model for your strategy and organizational culture. thats an improvement that is coming. also the structure of the standard has evolved to be easier to use and more agile. it has been designed to evolve through new and improved versions more frequently than in the past. we also have other components coming into the portfolio. one of them is theagile architecture standard which is going to bereleased soon. that one is going straight into the agile space. its proposing a holistic view of the organization. this coupling between agile and digital is addressed in that standard. it is also suitable to be used along with the togaf standard. both complement each other. the dpbok is also evolving to address new trends in the market. we also have other standards. themicroservice architectureis a very active working group that is delivering guidance on microservices delivered using the togaf standard. another important one is thezero trust architecturein the security space. now more than ever as we go virtual and rely on platforms we need to be sure that we are having proper consistency in security and compliance. we have for example thegeneral data protection regulation gdprconsiderations which are stronger than ever. those kinds of security breaches are addressed in that specific context. theititstandard which is another reference architecture is evolving toward becoming more oriented to a digital product concept to precisely address all of those changes. all of these standards all the pieces are moving together. there are other things coming for example delivering standards to serve specific areas like oil gas and electricity which are more facilityoriented more physicallyoriented. we are also working toward those to be sure that we are addressing all of the different possibilities. another very important thing here is we are aiming for every standard we deliver into the market to have a certification program along with it. we have that for the togaf standard archimate standard itit anddpbok. so the idea is to continue increasing our portfolio of certification along with the portfolio of standards. furthermore we have more credentials as part of the togafcertificationto allow people to go into specializations. for example im togafcertified but i also wanted to go for a solution architect practitioner or a digital architect. so we are combining the different products that we have different standards to have these building blocks were putting together for this learning curve around certifications which is an important part of our offering. gardneri think its important to illustrate where these standards are put to work and how organizations find the right balance between a minimum viable architecture and a maximum value portfolio for agility. so lets go through our panel for some examples. are there organizations you are working with that come to mind that have found and struck the right balance are they using a portfolio to gain agility and integration across organizational boundaries homanthe key part for me is do these resources help people do architecture and in some of the organizations ive worked with some of the greatest successes have been where they have been able to pick and choose  cherry pick if you like  bits of different things and create a toolkit. its not about following just one thing. its about having a kit. the reason i mentioned that is because one of the examples i want to reference has to do with development of ecosystems. in ecosystems its about how organizations work with each other to deliver some kind of customercentric propositions. ive seen this in the construction industry in particular where lots of organizations historically have had to come together to undertake large construction efforts. so thats one industry that always had ecosystems but it has come in and therefore architects have had to better collaborate and find ways to integrate beyond the boundary of their organization coming back to the whole mission of boundaryless information flow if you will. gardnerchris any examples that put a spotlight on some of the best uses of standards and the best applicability of them particularly for fostering agility frostyes a number of customers in both the private and public sector are going through this transition to using agile processes. some have been there for quite some time some are just starting on that journey. we shouldnt be surprised by this in the public and private sectors because everybody is reacting to the same market fundamentals driving the need for agile delivery. weve certainly worked with a few customers that have been very much at the forefront of developing new agile practices and how that integrates with ea and benefits from all of the good architectural skills and experiences that are in frameworks like the togaf standard. paul talked about developing ecosystems. weve seen things such as organizations embarking on largescale internal reengineering where they are adjusting their own internal it portfolios to react to the changing marketplace that they are confronted by. i am seeing a lot of common problems about fitting together agile techniques and architecture and needing to work in these iterative styles. but overwhelmingly these problems are being solved. we are seeing the benefits of this iterative way of working with rapid feedback and the more rapid response to changing market techniques. i would say even inside the open group were seeing some of the effects of that. weve been talking about the development of some of the agile guidance for the togaf standard within the open group and even within the working group itself weve seen adaption of more agile styles of working using some of the tools that are common in agile activities. things likegitlabandslackand these sorts of things. so it really is quite a pervasive thing we are seeing in the marketplace. gardnersonia are there any examples that come to mind that illustrate where organizations will be in the coming few years when it comes to the right intersection of agile architecture and the use of open standard any early adopters if you will or trendsetters that come to mind that illustrate where we should be expecting more organizations to be in the near future,107,0.019,0.847,0.134,0.9998,21.866281509399414,"['gonzalezth', 'evolv', 'rapid', 'order', 'agil', 'digit', 'enterpris', 'differ', 'thing', 'need', 'chang', 'around', 'organ', 'busi', 'issu',

61,62,Dana Gardner's BriefingsDirect,https://www.briefingsdirectblog.com/,2020-10-05,"Whenever
a problem would surface, we would work with the support team. Our goal was for a
customer to see a problem only once. And then we would rapidly fix that problem
for every other customer. In fact, we would fix it preemptively so customers would
never have to see it. So, we evolved this culture of identifying problems,
creating signatures for these problems, and then running everybody’s data
through the signatures so that customers would be preemptively inoculated from
these problems. That’s why it became very successful.  For example, we now see more-and-more the need to have an outside-in view of the market and trends. Being efficient and effective is not enough anymore. We need to innovate to figure out what the market is asking for. And sometimes to even generate that demand and generate new digital offerings for your market. That means more experimentation and more innovation, keeping in mind that in order to really deliver that digital offering you must have the right capabilities, so changes in your business and operational models, your backbone, need to be identified and then of course connected and delivered through technical platforms. Data is also another key component. We have several working groups and Forums working around data management and data science. If you don’t have the information, you won’t be able to understand your customers. That’s another trend, having a more customer journey-oriented view. At the end, you need to give your value to your end users and of course also internally to your company.
 

That’s why even internally, at The Open Group, we are considering having
 our own standards get a closer view of the customer. That is something 
that companies need to be addressing. And for them to do that, 
practitioners need to be able to develop new skills and to evolve 
rapidly. They will need to study not only the new technology trends, but
 how you can communicate that to your business, so more communications, 
marketing, and a more aggressive approach through innovation. Sustainability is another area we are considering at The Open Group, being able to deliver standards that will support organizations make better use of resources internally and externally and selecting the tools to be sustainable within their environments.   Those are some of the things we see for the coming years. As we have all learned this year, we should be able to shift very quickly. I was recently reading a very good blog that said agile is not only having a good engine, but also having a good steering wheel to be able to change direction quickly. That’s a very good metaphor for how you should evolve. It’s great to have a good engine, but you need to have a good direction, and that direction is precisely what they need to pay attention to, not being agile only for the sake of being agile. So, that’s the direction we are taking with our whole portfolio. We are also considering other areas. For example, we are trying to improve our offering in vertical industry areas. We have other things on the move like Open Communities, especially for the ArchiMate Standard, which is one of our executable standards easier to be implemented using architecture tools. So, those are the kinds of things in our strategy at The Open Group as we work to serve our customers. Gardner: And what’s next when it comes to The Open Group events? How are you helping people become the types of architects who reach that balance between agility and structure in the next wave of digital innovation? Gonzalez: We have many different kinds of customers. We have our members, of course. We have our trainers. We have people that are not members but are using our standards and they are very important. They might eventually become members. So, we have been identifying those different markets on building customer journeys for all of them in order to serve them properly. Serving them, for example, means providing better ways for them to find information on our website and to get access to our resources. All of our publications are free to be downloaded and used if you are and end user organization. You only need a commercial license if you will apply them to deliver services to others. In terms of events, we have had a very good experience with virtual events. The good thing about our crisis is that you can use it for learning, and we have learned that virtual events are very good. First, because we can address more coverage. For example, if you organize a face-to-face event in Europe, probably people from Europe will attend, but it’s very unlikely that people from Asia or even the U.S. or Latin America will attend. But a virtual event, also being free events, are attracting people from different countries, different geographies. For next year, probably we are going to have some kind of a mix of virtual and face-to-face, because, of course, face-to-face is very important. And for our members, for example, sharing experiences as a network is a value that you can only have if you’re physically there. So, probably for next year, depending on how the situation is evolving, it will be a mix of virtual and face-to-face events.   Listen to the podcast. Find it on iTunes.

(AI) increasingly
supports IT operations.
 One
of the most successful uses of machine learning (ML) and AI for IT efficiency
has been the InfoSight technology developed at
Nimble Storage, now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).   Please welcome a Nimble Storage founder, along with a cutting-edge machine
learning architect, to examine the expanding role and impact of HPE InfoSight
in making IT resiliency better than ever. Listen to the podcast. Find it on iTunes. Read a full transcript or download a copy. To
learn more about the latest IT operations solutions that help companies deliver
agility and edge-to-cloud business continuity, we’re joined by Varun Mehta, Vice President and
General Manager for InfoSight at HPE and founder of Nimble Storage, and David Adamson, Machine Learning Architect at HPE InfoSight. The discussion is moderated by Dana Gardner, Principal Analyst at Interarbor Solutions. Here are some excerpts: Gardner: Varun, what was the
primary motivation for creating HPE InfoSight? What did you have in mind when
you built this technology? Mehta: Various forms of call
home were already in place when we started Nimble, and that’s what we had
set up to do. But then we realized that the call home data was used to do very
simple actions. It was basically to look at the data one time and try and find
problems that the machine was having right then. These were very obvious issues,
like a crash. If you had had any kind of software crash, that’s what call home
data would identify. The
enabler was that a new database became available. We found that rather than
just scan once, we could put everyone’s data into one place, look at it, and discover
issues across the entire population. That was very powerful. And then we could
do other interesting things using data science such as workload planning from
all of that data. So the realization was that if the databases became
available, we could do a lot more with that data.
 Gardner: And by taking
advantage of that large data capability and the distribution of analytics
through a cloud model, did the scope and relevancy of what HPE InfoSight did exceed
your expectations? How far has this now come? Mehta: It turned out that
this model was really successful. They say that, “imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery.” And that was proven true, too. Our customers loved it, our competitors
found out that our customers loved it, and it basically spawned an entire set
of features across all of our competitors. The
reason our customers loved it -- followed by our competitors -- was that it
gave people a much broader idea of the issues they were facing. We then found
that people wanted to expand this envelope of understanding that we had created
beyond just storage. Data
delivers more than a quick fix And
that led to people wanting to understand how their hypervisor was doing, for
example. And so, we expanded the capability to look into that. People loved the
solution and wanted us to expand the scope into far more than just storage
optimization. Gardner: David, you hear Varun
describing what this was originally intended for. As a machine learning architect,
how has HPE InfoSight provided you with a foundation to do increasingly more
when it comes to AIOps, dependability, and reliability of platforms and systems? That
allowed us to spend time investigating more interesting and advanced problems,
which demanded ML solutions. Once you’ve cleaned up the Pareto curve of all the simple
tasks that can be automated with simple rules or SQL statements, you uncover problems
that take longer to solve and require a look at time series and telemetry that’s
quantitative in nature and multidimensional. That data opens up the requirement
to use more sophisticated techniques in order to make actionable recommendations. Gardner: Speaking of actionable,
something that really impressed me when I first learned
about HPE InfoSight,
Varun, was how quickly you can take the analytics and apply them. Why has that
rapid capability to dynamically impact what’s going on from the data proved so
successful? 
 Support
to succeed Mehta: It turned out to be
one of the key points of our success. I really have to compliment the deep
partnership that our support organization has had with the HPE InfoSight team. The
support team right from the beginning prided themselves on providing
outstanding service. Part of the proof of that was incredible Net Promoter scores (NPS), which is this independent
measurement of how satisfied customers are with our products. Nimble’s NPS
score was 86, which is even higher than Apple. We prided ourselves on providing
a really strong support experience to the customer.",whenevera problem would surface we would work with the support team. our goal was for acustomer to see a problem only once. and then we would rapidly fix that problemfor every other customer. in fact we would fix it preemptively so customers wouldnever have to see it. so we evolved this culture of identifying problemscreating signatures for these problems and then running everybodys datathrough the signatures so that customers would be preemptively inoculated fromthese problems. thats why it became very successful.  for example we now

customers. we have our members of course. we have our trainers. we have people that are not members but are using our standards and they are very important. they might eventually become members. so we have been identifying those different markets on building customer journeys for all of them in order to serve them properly. serving them for example means providing better ways for them to find information on ourwebsiteand to get access to our resources. all of our publications are free to be downloaded and used if you are and end user organization. you only need a commercial license if you will apply them to deliver services to others. in terms of events we have had a very good experience withvirtual events. the good thing about our crisis is that you can use it for learning and we have learned that virtual events are very good. first because we can address more coverage. for example if you organize a facetoface event in europe probably people from europe will attend but its very unlikely that people from asia or even the u.s. or latin america will attend. but a virtual event also being free events are attracting people from different countries different geographies. for next year probably we are going to have some kind of a mix of virtual and facetoface because of course facetoface is very important. and for our members for example sharing experiences as a network is a value that you can only have if youre physically there. so probably for next year depending on how the situation is evolving it will be a mix of virtual and facetoface events.   listento thepodcast.

help companies deliveragility and edgetocloud business continuity were joined by varun mehta vice president andgeneral manager for infosight at hpe and founder of nimble storage and david adamson machine learning architect at hpe infosight. the discussion is moderated by dana gardner principal analyst at interarbor solutions. here are some excerpts gardner varun what was theprimary motivation for creating hpe infosight what did you have in mind whenyou built this technology mehta various forms of callhome were already in place when we started nimble and thats what we hadset up to do. but then we realized that the call home data was used to do verysimple actions. it was basically to look at the data one time and try and findproblems that the machine was having right then. these were very obvious issueslike a crash. if you had had any kind of software crash thats what call homedata would identify. theenabler was that a new database became available. we found that rather thanjust scan once we could put everyones data into one place look at it and discoverissues across the entire population. that was very powerful. and then we coulddo other interesting things using data science such as workload planning fromall of that data. so the realization was that if the databases becameavailable we could do a lot more with that data. gardner and by takingadvantage of that large data capability and the distribution of analyticsthrough a cloud model did the scope and relevancy of what hpe infosight did exceedyour expectations how far has this now come mehta it turned out thatthis model was really successful. they say that imitation is the sincerestform of flattery. and that was proven true too. our customers loved it our competitorsfound out that our customers loved it and it basically spawned an entire setof features across all of our competitors. thereason our customers loved it  followed by our competitors  was that itgave people a much broader idea of the issues they were facing. we then foundthat people wanted to expand this envelope of understanding that we had createdbeyond just storage. datadelivers more than a quick fix andthat led to people wanting to understand how their hypervisor was doing forexample. and so we expanded the capability to look into that. people loved thesolution and wanted us to expand the scope into far more than just storageoptimization. gardner david you hear varundescribing what this was originally intended for. as a machine learning architecthow has hpe infosight provided you with a foundation to do increasingly morewhen it comes to aiops dependability and reliability of platforms and systems thatallowed us to spend time investigating more interesting and advanced problemswhich demanded ml solutions. once youve cleaned up the pareto curve of all the simpletasks that can be automated with simple rules or sql statements you uncover problemsthat take longer to solve and require a look at time series and telemetry thatsquantitative in nature and multidimensional. that data opens up the requirementto use more sophisticated techniques in order to make actionable recommendations. gardner speaking of actionablesomething that really impressed me when i first learnedabout hpe infosightvarun was how quickly you can take the analytics and apply them. why has thatrapid capability to dynamically impact whats going on from the data proved sosuccessful supportto succeed mehta it turned out to beone of the key points of our success. i really have to compliment the deeppartnership that our support organization has had with the hpe infosight team. thesupport team right from the beginning prided themselves on providingoutstanding service. part of the proof of that was incredible net promoter scores nps which is this independentmeasurement of how satisfied customers are with our products. nimbles npsscore was  which is even higher than apple. we prided ourselves on providinga

support and data science team up  Gardner: It hasn’t been that
long since we were dealing with red light-green light types of IT support scenarios,
but we’ve come a long way. We’re not all the way to fully automated, lights-out,
machines running machines operations. David,
where do you think we are on that automated support spectrum? How has HPE InfoSight
helped change the nature of systems’ dependability, getting closer to that
point where they are more automated and more intelligent? Adamson: The challenge with fully
automated infrastructure stems from the variety of different components in the environments
-- and all of the interoperability among those components. If you look at just
a simple IT stack, they are typically applications on top of virtual machines
(VMs), on top of hosts -- they may or may not have independent storage attached
– and then the networking of all these components. That’s discounting all the
different applications and various software components required to run them.  But
then you need to add intelligence on top of that, and that intelligence needs
to not only understand all of the components and their dependencies, but also what
kinds of exceptions can arise and what is important to the end users. So
far, with HPE InfoSight, we go so far as to pull in all of our subject matter
expertise into the models and exception-handling automation. We may not necessarily
have upfront information about what the most important parts of your
environment are. Instead, we can stop and let the user provide some judgment. It’s
truly about messaging to the user the different alternative approaches that
they can take. As we see exceptions happening, we can provide those
recommendations in a clean and interpretable way, so [the end user] can bring
context to bear that we don’t necessarily have ourselves. Gardner: And the timing for
these advanced IT operations services is very auspicious. Just as we’re now
able to extend intelligence, we’re also at the point where we have end-to-end
requirements – from the edge, to the cloud, and back to the data center. And
under such a hybrid IT approach, we are also facing a great need for general digital
transformation in businesses, especially as they seek to be agile and best react
to the COVID-19 pandemic. Are we able yet to apply HPE InfoSight across such a
horizontal architecture problem? How far can it go? Seeing
the future: End-to-end visibility  Mehta: Just to continue from
where David started, part of our limitation so far has been from where we began.
We started out in storage, and then as Nimble became part of HPE, we expanded
it to compute resources. We targeted hypervisors; we are expanding it now to
applications. To really fix problems, you need to have end-to-end visibility. And
so that is our goal, to analyze, identify, and fix problems end-to-end. That
is one of the axis of development we’re pursuing. The other axis of development
is that things are just becoming more-and-more complex. As businesses require
their IT infrastructure to become highly adaptable they also need scalability,
self-healing, and enhanced performance. To achieve this, there is greater-and-greater
complexity. And part of that complexity has been driven by really poor
utilization of resources. Go
back 20 years and we had standalone compute and storage machines that were not
individually very well-utilized. Then you had virtualization come along, and
virtualization gave you much higher utilization -- but it added a whole layer
of complexity. You had one machine, but now you could have 10 VMs in that one place. Now,
we have containers coming out, and that’s going to further increase complexity
by a factor of 10. And right on the horizon, we have serverless computing,
which will increase the complexity another order of magnitude.   One
of the things that’s happened with the COVID-19 pandemic response is the need
for very quick response stats. For example, people have had to quickly set up
web sites for contact tracing, reporting on the diseases, and for vaccines use.
That shows an accelerated manner in how people need digital solutions -- and it’s
just not possible without serious automation. Gardner: Varun just laid out
the complexity and the demands for both the business and the technology. It
sounds like a problem that mere mortals cannot solve. So how are we helping
those mere mortals to bring AI to bear in a way that allows them to benefit – but,
as Varun also pointed out, allows them to trust that technology and use it to
its full potential? Complexity
requires automated assistance Adamson: The point Varun is
making is key. If you are talking about complexity, we’re well beyond the point
where people could realistically expect to log-in to each machine to find, analyze,
or manage exceptions that happen across this ever-growing, complex regime. Even
if you’re at a place where you have the observability solved, and you’re
monitoring all of these moving parts together in one place -- even then, it
easily becomes overwhelming, with pages and pages of dashboards. You couldn’t
employ enough people to monitor and act to spot everything that you need to be
spotting. You
need to be able to trust automated exception [finding] methods to handle the
scope and complexity of what people are dealing with now. So that means doing a
few things. People
will often start with naïve thresholds. They create manual thresholds to give alerts
to handle really critical issues, such as all the servers went down. But
there are often more subtle issues that show up that you wouldn’t necessarily
have anticipated setting a threshold for. Or maybe your threshold isn’t right.
It depends on context. Maybe the metrics that you’re looking at are just the
raw metrics you’re pulling out of the system and aren’t even the metrics that give
a reliable signal.   For
the problems that IT support provides to us, we apply automation and we move
down the Pareto chart to solve things in priority of importance. We also turn to
ML models. In some of these cases, we can train a model from the installed base
and use a peer-learning approach, where we understand the correlations between
problem states and indicator variables well enough so that we can identify a
root cause for different customers and different issues. Sometimes
though, if the issue is rare enough, scanning the installed base isn’t going to
give us a high enough signal to the noise. Then we can take some of these curated
examples from support and do a semi-supervised loop. We basically say, “We have
three examples that are known. We’re going to train a model on them.” Maybe
it’s a few tens of thousands of data points, but it’s still in the three
examples, so there’s co-correlation that we are worried about. 
 Gardner: As you are refining and
improving these models, one of the benefits in being a part of HPE is to access
growing data sets across entire industries, regions, and in fact the globe. So,
Varun, what is the advantage of being part of HPE and extending those datasets
to allow for the budding models to become even more accurate and powerful over
time? Gain
a global point of view Mehta: Being part of HPE has enabled
us to leapfrog our competition. As I said, our roots are in storage, but really
storage is just the foundation of where things are located in an organization.
There is compute, networking, hypervisors, operating systems, and applications.
With HPE, we certainly now cover the base infrastructure, which is storage followed
by compute. At some point we will bring in networking. We already have
hypervisor monitoring, and we are actively working on application monitoring. HPE
has allowed us to radically increase the scope of what we can look at, which
also means we can radically improve the quality of the solutions we offer to our
customers. And so it’s been a win-win solution, both for HPE where we can offer
a lot of different insights into our products, and for our customers where we
can offer them faster solutions to more kinds of problems. Gardner: David, anything more
to offer on the depth, breadth, and scope of data as it’s helping you improve
the models? Adamson: I certainly agree with
everything that Varun said. The one thing I might add is in the feedback we’ve received
over time. And that is, one of the key things in making the notifications
possible is getting us as close as possible to the customer experience of the
applications and services running on the infrastructure. Gardner: And as we think about
the extensibility of the solution -- extending past storage into compute, ultimately
networking, and applications -- there is the need to deal with the heterogeneity
of architecture. So multicloud, hybrid cloud, edge-to-cloud, and many edges to
cloud. Has HPE InfoSight been designed in a way to extend it across different IT
topologies? Across
all architecture Mehta: At heart, we are
building a big data warehouse. You know, part of the challenge is that we’ve
had this explosion in the amount of data that we can bring home. For the last
10 years, since InfoSight was first developed, the tools have gotten a lot more
powerful. What we now want to do is take advantage of those tools so we can
bring in more data and provide even better analytics. The
first step is to deal with all of these use cases. Beyond that, there will
probably be custom solutions. For example, you talked about edge-to-cloud.
There will be locations where you have good bandwidth, such as a colocation
center, and you can send back large amounts of data. But if you’re sitting as
the only compute in a large retail store like a Home Depot, for example, or a McDonald’s, then the bandwidth back is going to be
limited. You have to live within that and still provide effective monitoring.
So I’m sure we will have to make some adjustments as we widen our scope, but
the key is having a really strong foundation and that’s what we’re working on
right now. Gardner:
David,
anything more to offer on the extensibility across different types of
architecture, of analyzing the different sources of analytics? Adamson:
Yes, originally,
when we were storage-focused and grew to the hypervisor level, we discovered
some things about the way we keep our data organized. If we made it more
modular, we could make it easier to write simple rules and build complex models
to keep turnaround time fast. We developed some experience and so we’ve taken that
and applied it in the most recent release of recommendations into our customer
portal. Modularizing
our data model to truly accommodate that has been something that we started
along the path for and I think we’re making good strides toward. The
other piece is in terms of the data science. We’re trying to leverage
longitudinal data as much as possible, but we want to make sure we have a sufficient
set of meaningful ML offerings. So we’re looking at unsupervised learning
capabilities that we can apply to environments for which we don’t have a critical
mass of data yet, especially as we onboard monitoring for new applications.
That’s been quite exciting to work on. Gardner:
We’ve
been talking a lot about the HPE InfoSight technology, but there also has to be
considerations for culture. A big part of digital transformation is getting
silos between people broken down. Is there a cultural silo
between the data scientists and the IT operations people? Are we able to get
the IT operations people to better understand what data science can do for them
and their jobs? And perhaps, also allow the data scientists to understand the
requirements of a modern, complex IT operations organization? How is it going
between these two groups, and how well are they melding?",itsupport and data science team up  gardner it hasnt been thatlong since we were dealing with red lightgreen light types of it support

businesses requiretheir it infrastructure to become highly adaptable they also need scalabilityselfhealing and enhanced performance. to achieve this there is greaterandgreatercomplexity. and part of that complexity has been driven by really poorutilization of resources. goback  years and we had standalone compute and storage machines that were notindividually very wellutilized. then you had virtualization come along andvirtualization gave you much higher utilization  but it added a whole layerof complexity. you had one machine but now you could have  vms in that one place. nowwe have containers coming out and thats going to further increase complexityby a factor of . and right on the horizon we have serverless computingwhich will increase the complexity another order of magnitude.  oneof the things thats happened with the covid pandemic response is the needfor very quick response stats. for example people have had to quickly set upweb sites for contact tracing reporting on the diseases and for vaccines use.that shows an accelerated manner in how people need digital solutions  and itsjust not possible without serious automation. gardner varun just laid outthe complexity and the demands for both the business and the technology. itsounds like a problem that mere mortals cannot solve. so how are we helpingthose mere mortals to bring ai to bear in a way that allows them to benefit  butas varun also pointed out allows them to trust that technology and use it toits full potential complexityrequires automated assistance adamson the point varun ismaking is key. if you are talking about complexity were well beyond the pointwhere people could realistically expect to login to each machine to find analyzeor manage exceptions that happen across this evergrowing complex regime. evenif youre at a place where you have the observability solved and youremonitoring all of these moving parts together in one place  even then iteasily becomes overwhelming with pages and pages of dashboards. you couldntemploy enough people to monitor and act to spot everything that you need to bespotting. youneed to be able to trust automated exception finding methods to handle thescope and complexity of what people are dealing with now. so that means doing afew things. peoplewill often start with nave thresholds. they create manual thresholds to give alertsto handle really critical issues such as all the servers went down. butthere are often more subtle issues that show up that you wouldnt necessarilyhave anticipated setting a threshold for. or maybe your threshold isnt right.it depends on context. maybe the metrics that youre looking at are just theraw metrics youre pulling out of the system and arent even the metrics that givea reliable signal.  forthe problems that it support provides to us we apply automation and we movedown the pareto chart to solve things in priority of importance. we also turn toml models. in some of these cases we can train a model from the installed baseand use a peerlearning approach where we understand the correlations betweenproblem states and indicator variables well enough so that we can identify aroot cause for different customers and different issues. sometimesthough if the issue is rare enough scanning the installed base isnt going togive us a high enough signal to the noise. then we can take some of these curatedexamples from support and do a semisupervised loop. we basically say we havethree examples that are known. were going to train a model on them. maybeits a few tens of thousands of data points but its still in the threeexamples so theres cocorrelation that we are worried about. gardner as you are refining andimproving these models one of the benefits in being a part of hpe is to accessgrowing data sets across entire industries regions and in fact the globe. sovarun what is the advantage of being part of hpe and extending those datasetsto allow for the budding models to become even more accurate and powerful overtime gaina global point of view mehta being part of hpe has enabledus to leapfrog our competition. as i said our roots are in storage but reallystorage is just the foundation of where things are located in an organization.there is compute networking hypervisors operating systems and applications.with hpe we certainly now cover the base infrastructure which is storage followedby compute. at some point we will bring in networking. we already havehypervisor monitoring and we are actively working on application monitoring. hpehas allowed us to radically increase the scope of what we can look at whichalso means we can radically improve the quality of the solutions we offer to ourcustomers. and so its been a winwin solution both for hpe where we can offera lot of different insights into our products and for our customers where wecan offer them faster solutions to more kinds of problems. gardner david anything moreto offer on the depth breadth and scope of data as its helping you improvethe models adamson i certainly agree witheverything that varun said. the one thing i might add is in the feedback weve receivedover time. and that is one of the key things in making the notificationspossible is getting us as close as possible to the customer experience of theapplications and services running on the infrastructure. gardner and as we think aboutthe extensibility of the solution  extending past storage into compute ultimatelynetworking and applications  there is the need to deal with the heterogeneityof architecture. so multicloud hybrid cloud edgetocloud and many edges tocloud. has hpe infosight been designed in a way to extend it across different ittopologies acrossall architecture mehta at heart we arebuilding a big data warehouse. you know part of the challenge is that wevehad this explosion in the amount of data that we can bring home. for the last years since infosight was first developed the tools have gotten a lot morepowerful. what we now want to do is take advantage of those tools so we canbring in more data and provide even better analytics. thefirst step is to deal with all of these use cases. beyond that there willprobably be custom solutions. for example you talked about edgetocloud.there will be locations where you have good bandwidth such as a colocationcenter and you can send back large amounts of data. but if youre sitting asthe only compute in a large retail store like a home depot for example or a mcdonalds then the bandwidth back is going to belimited. you have to live within that and still provide effective monitoring.so im sure we will have to make some adjustments as we widen our scope butthe key is having a really strong foundation and thats what were working onright now. gardnerdavidanything more to offer on the extensibility across different types ofarchitecture of analyzing the different sources of analytics adamsonyes originallywhen we were storagefocused and grew to the hypervisor level we discoveredsome things about the way we keep our data organized. if we made it moremodular we could make it easier to write simple rules and build complex modelsto keep turnaround time fast. we developed some experience and so weve taken thatand applied it in the most recent release of recommendations into our customerportal. modularizingour data model to truly accommodate that has been something that we startedalong the path for and i think were making good strides toward. theother piece is in terms of the data science. were trying to leveragelongitudinal data as much as possible but we want to make sure we have a sufficientset of meaningful ml offerings. so were looking at unsupervised learningcapabilities that we can apply to environments for which we dont have a criticalmass of data yet especially as we onboard monitoring for new applications.thats been quite exciting to work on. gardnerwevebeen talking a lot about the hpe infosight technology but there also has to beconsiderations for culture. a big part of digital transformation is gettingsilos between people broken down. is there a cultural silobetween the data scientists and the it operations people are we able to getthe it operations people to better understand what data science can do for themand their jobs and perhaps also allow the data scientists to understand therequirements of a modern complex it operations organization how is it goingbetween these two groups and how well are they melding,101,0.023,0.875,0.102,0.9993,19.679960250854492,"['itsupport',

70,71,How Amazon is solving big-data challenges with data lakes - All Things Distributed,https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/01/aws-datalake.html,2020-10-05,"It's also difficult to get granular details from the data, because not everybody has access to the various data repositories. For smaller queries, you could share a cut of the data in a spreadsheet. But challenges arise when data exceeds the capacity of a spreadsheet (which often happens for larger companies). In some cases, you could share a higher-level summary of the data, but then you're really not getting the full picture.   Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 fulfillment centers (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day. Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster. That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it. A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake.  The challenges Amazon has faced with big data are similar to the challenges many other companies face: data silos, difficulty analyzing diverse datasets, data controllership, data security, and incorporating machine learning (ML). Let's take a closer look at these challenges and see how a data lake can help solve them. A major reason companies choose to create data lakes is to break down data silos. Having pockets of data in different places, controlled by different groups, inherently obscures data. This often happens when a company grows fast and/or acquires new businesses. In the case of Amazon, it's been both. To expand internationally and create new shipping programs quickly (for example, FREE Same-Day Delivery or Amazon Fresh), most operations planning teams have been in control of their own data and technology. As a result, data is stored in different places and in different ways. This approach allows each team to tackle problems, respond to customer needs, and innovate faster. However, it's harder to make sense of the data at an organizational and company-wide level—it requires manual data collection from many different sources. With so many teams operating independently, we lose efficiencies that could be achieved by solving problems together.",its also difficult to get granular details from the data because not everybody

71,72,How Amazon is solving big-data challenges with data lakes - All Things Distributed,https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/01/aws-datalake.html,2020-10-05,"With a data lake, it's easier to get the right data to the right people at the right time. Instead of managing access for all the different locations in which data is stored, you only have to worry about one set of credentials. Data lakes have controls that allow authorized users to see, access, process, and/or modify specific assets. Data lakes help ensure that unauthorized users are blocked from taking actions that would compromise data confidentiality and security.  A data lake solves this problem by uniting all the data into one central location. Teams can continue to function as nimble units, but all roads lead back to the data lake for analytics. No more silos. Another challenge of using different systems and approaches to data management is that the data structures and information vary. For example, Amazon Prime has data for fulfillment centers and packaged goods, while Amazon Fresh has data for grocery stores and food. Even shipping programs differ internationally. For example, different countries sometimes have different box sizes and shapes. There's also an increasing amount of unstructured data coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices (like sensors on fulfillment center machines). What's more, different systems may also have the same type of information, but it's labeled differently.  For example, in Europe, the term used is ""cost per unit,"" but in North America, the term used is ""cost per package."" The date formats of the two terms are different. In this instance, a link needs to be made between the two labels so people analyzing the data know it refers to the same thing. If you wanted to combine all of this data in a traditional data warehouse without a data lake, it would require a lot of data preparation and export, transform, and load (ETL). You would have to make trade-offs on what to keep and what to lose and continually change the structure of a rigid system. Data lakes allow you to import any amount of data in any format because there is no pre-defined schema. You can even ingest data in real time. You can collect data from multiple sources and move it into the data lake in its original format. You can also build links between information that might be labeled differently but represents the same thing. Moving all your data to a data lake also improves what you can do with a traditional data warehouse. You have the flexibility to store highly structured, frequently accessed data in a data warehouse, while also keeping up to exabytes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in your data lake storage. With data stored in so many locations, it's difficult to both access all of it and to link to external tools for analysis. Amazon's operations finance data is spread across more than 25 databases with regional teams creating their own local version of datasets. That means over 25 access management credentials for some people. Many of the databases require access management support to do things like change profiles or reset passwords. In addition, audits and controls must be in place for each database to ensure that nobody has improper access.",with a data lake its easier to get the right data to the right people at the right time.

72,73,How Amazon is solving big-data challenges with data lakes - All Things Distributed,https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/01/aws-datalake.html,2020-10-05,"By moving all the data to a data lake, Amazon's operations finance team can combine datasets to train and deploy more accurate models. Training ML models with more relevant data increases the accuracy of forecasting. In addition, it frees employees who were performing this task manually to work on more strategic projects, like analyzing the forecasts to drive operations improvements in the field.  With a data lake, data is stored in an open format, which makes it easier to work with different analytic services. Open format also makes it more likely for the data to be compatible with tools that don't even exist yet. Various roles in your organization, like data scientists, data engineers, application developers, and business analysts, can access data with their choice of analytic tools and frameworks. You're not locked in to a small set of tools, and a broader group of people can make sense of the data. A data lake is a powerful foundation for ML and AI (artificial intelligence), because ML and AI thrive on large, diverse datasets. ML uses statistical algorithms that learn from existing data, a process called training, to make decisions about new data, a process called inference. During training, patterns and relationships in the data are identified to build a model. The model allows you to make intelligent decisions about data it hasn't encountered before. The more data you have the better you can train your ML models, resulting in improved accuracy. One of the biggest responsibilities of Amazon's worldwide operations finance team is planning and forecasting operating costs and capital expenditure for Amazon's supply chain, which includes the entire transportation network, hundreds of fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery stations, Whole Foods locations, Fresh pick-up points, and more. They help answer important high-level questions, like ""How many packages will we ship next year?"" and ""How much will we spend on salaries?"" They also address very specific questions, like ""How many boxes of each size do we need in Tampa, FL next month?""  The more accurate your forecast is, the better. If you estimate too low or too high, it can have negative consequences that affect your customers and your bottom line. For example, at Amazon, if we forecast demand too low, warehouse workers at a fulfillment center might not have enough supplies or there might not be enough drivers, which could lead to packages being delayed, more calls to customer service, orders being cancelled, and loss of customer trust. If we forecast too high, you could have inventory and boxes sitting around taking up valuable space in a warehouse. This situation means there's less room for products that are higher in demand. Most organizations, like Amazon, spend a lot of time trying to predict the future. Luckily, ML can improve forecasts. Last year, the Amazon operations finance team did a test. They took a subset of their forecasts and compared their traditional manual process against Amazon Forecast, a fully managed service that uses machine learning to deliver highly accurate forecasts. In this trial run, the forecasts completed by Forecast were 67% more accurate on average than the forecasts completed by the manual process.",by moving all the data to a data lake amazons operations

73,74,How Amazon is solving big-data challenges with data lakes - All Things Distributed,https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/01/aws-datalake.html,2020-10-05,"Originally posted on SiliconANGLE  Amazon's retail business uses some technology that predates the creation of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which started in 2006. To become more scalable, efficient, performant, and secure, many workloads in Amazon's retail business have moved to AWS over the last decade. The Galaxy data lake is a critical component of a larger big data platform known internally as Galaxy. The figure below shows some of the ways Galaxy relies on AWS and some of the AWS services it uses.  The Galaxy data lake is built on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), an object storage service that offers unmatched availability, durability, and scalability. Some data is also housed on Amazon proprietary file-based data stores, Andes and Elastic Data eXchange, both of which are service layers on top of Amazon S3. Some other data sources are Amazon Redshift, a data warehouse, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), a relational database, and enterprise applications. AWS Glue, a fully managed ETL service that makes it easy for you to prepare and load data for analytics, and AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) are used to onboard the various data sets to Amazon S3. Galaxy combines metadata assets from multiple services, including Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, and the AWS Glue Data Catalog, into a unified catalog layer built on Amazon DynamoDB, a key-value and document database. Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) is used to enable faster search queries on the catalog. After the data has been cataloged (onboarded), various services are used at the client layer. For example, Amazon Athena, an interactive query service, for ad hoc exploratory queries using standard SQL; Amazon Redshift, a service for more structured queries and reporting; and Amazon SageMaker, for machine learning. The Amazon team created the Galaxy data lake architecture from the ground up. They had to develop many of the components manually over months, which is similar to how other companies have had to do this in the past. In August 2019, AWS released a new service called AWS Lake Formation. It allows you to streamline the data lake creation process and build a secure data lake in days instead of months. Lake Formation helps you collect and catalog data from databases and object storage, move the data into your new Amazon S3 data lake, clean and classify your data using machine learning algorithms, and secure access to your sensitive data. By storing data in a unified repository in open standards-based data formats, data lakes allow you to break down silos, use a variety of analytics services to get the most insights from your data, and cost-effectively grow your storage and data processing needs over time. For Amazon's financial operations team, the Galaxy data lake will provide an integrated experience for its worldwide users. The infrastructure for Galaxy was built in 2019, and now the various database systems are moving into the data lake. The teams using the tool now are already seeing its benefits, citing the removal of manual processes and clunky spreadsheets, an increase in productivity, and having more time available for value-added analysis. I look forward to following the team's progress this year to see how the data lake continues to get them better data, faster.

As we crested the initial climb, we were rewarded with a bright red sunrise that looked like fire in the sky.  Three years ago I headed off to Tāupo with some of my oldest friends to race the 2017 edition of the Taupo ultra 100km. I’d previously raced the inaugural event in 2016 which doubled as my first stab at 100km. You can read about it here but suffice it to say my fail was epic in its proportions. When Ed, a school buddy who had been working overseas for 20 years, suggested coming back to race the event, I jumped at the opportunity. Third mate Paul stepped up to race the 50km, his first ultra, and Yonni came along to attempt his first 100km. That race saw a mixed bag of results. Yonni and I ran together for 30km before I trotted off on my own coming in at 6th place in around 10:42. Yonni did superbly given he was only 17 years old at the time and took 16th overall. Paul knocked off his first ultra in typically relaxed style while Ed had a hard day and missed the cutoffs at 76km. Roll on this year and new goals were set: Ed was adamant he’d finish the race, no matter what. Paul agreed to pace him for the last 24km and Yonni, in his inimitable style, was full of smack talk and claims he’d beat me and run a sub-10-hour race. We all convened in Wellington from our respective homes and, joined by Jo, Paul’s awesome partner, we began the long road trip to Taupo. Everyone was pretty relaxed – Paul’s job was physically easy, but potentially psychologically tricky depending on Ed’s mental state after so many hours. Yonni was relaxed after some good training runs in the weeks leading up to the event and my only concern was based around my ambition to stay with him for the entire race and have another father-and-son, start-to-finish, outing. Dinner pre-Taupo is traditionally Pauly’s burger joint (Pro tip: when in Taupo, visit Pauly’s at least once) so our fat and carb levels were well primed for the race. All set. Burgers consumed 🍔. Lets go! 💥 Tracking link in my bio 🏃 A post shared by  Yonni Kepes (@yonnikepes) on Oct 8, 2020 at 8:42pm PDT    A 3 am rise on Saturday, pre-race breakfast and a drive to the start line ensued and we lined up ready to go. With a swing bridge to cross after only a few hundred metres, Yonni and I agreed to start on the front line and hit the bridge near the front, which we did successfully. In what was potentially a dangerous move, we kept up a similar high pace from there in, consistently running well under 6 minutes a kilometre and hence upon our goal pace for a 10-hour race.",the first km was lovely  running in the dark across beautiful buttery trails. as we crested the initial climb we were rewarded with a bright red sunrise that looked like fire in the sky.  three years ago i headed off to tupo with some of my oldest friends to race the  edition of the taupo ultra km. id previously raced the inaugural event in  which doubled as my first stab at km. you can read about it here but suffice it to say my fail was epic in its proportions. when ed a school buddy who had been working overseas for  years suggested coming back to race the event i jumped at the opportunity. third mate paul stepped up to race the km his first ultra and yonni came along to attempt his first km. that race saw a mixed bag of results. yonni and i ran together for km before i trotted off on my own coming in at th place in around . yonni did superbly given he was only  years old at the time and took th overall. paul knocked off his first ultra in typically relaxed style while ed had a hard day and missed the cutoffs at km. roll on this year and new goals were set ed was adamant hed finish the race no matter what. paul agreed to pace him for the last km and yonni in his inimitable style was full of smack talk and claims hed beat me and run a subhour race. we all convened in wellington from our respective homes and joined by jo pauls awesome partner we began the long road trip to taupo. everyone was pretty relaxed  pauls job was physically easy but potentially psychologically tricky depending on eds mental state after so many hours. yonni was relaxed after some good training runs in the weeks leading up to the event and my only concern was based around my ambition to stay with him for the entire race and have another fatherandson starttofinish outing. dinner pretaupo is traditionally paulys burger joint pro tip when in taupo visit paulys at least once so our fat and carb levels were well primed for the race. all set. burgers consumed . lets go  tracking link in my bio  a post shared by  yonni kepes   on oct   at pm pdt   a  am rise on saturday prerace breakfast and a drive to the start line ensued and we lined up ready to go. with a swing bridge to cross after only a few hundred metres yonni and i agreed to start on the front line and hit the bridge near the front which we did successfully. in what was potentially a dangerous move we kept up a similar high pace from there in consistently running well under  minutes a kilometre and hence upon our goal pace for a hour race.,23,0.043,0.821,0.136,0.9934,24.755281448364258,"['first', 'love', 'run', 'dark', 'across', 'beauti', 'butteri', 'trail', 'crest', 'initi', 'climb', 'reward', 'bright', 'red', 'sunris', 'look', 'fire', 'sky', 'three', 'year', 'ago', 'head', 'tupo', 'oldest', 'friend', 'race', 'edit', 'taupo', 'ultra', 'previous', 'race', 'inaugur', 'event', 'doubl', 'first', 'stab', 'read', 'suffic', 'fail', 'epic', 'proport', 'school', 'buddi', 'work', 'oversea', 'year', 'suggest', 'come', 'back', 'race', 'event', 'jump', 'opportun', 'third', 'mate', 'paul', 'step', 'race', 'first', 'ultra', 'yonni', 'came', 'along', 'attempt', 'first', 'race', 'saw', 'mix', 'bag', 'result', 'yonni', 'ran', 'togeth', 'trot', 'come', 'place', 'around', 'yonni', 'superbl', 'given', 'year', 'old', 'time', 'took', 'overal', 'paul', 'knock', 'first', 'ultra', 'typic', 'relax', 'style', 'hard', 'day', 'miss', 'cutoff', 'roll', 'year', 'new', 'goal', 'set', 'adam', 'hed', 'finish', 'race', 'matter', 'paul', 'agre', 'pace', 'last', 'yonni', 'inimit', 'style', 'full', 'smack', 'talk', 'claim', 'hed', 'beat', 'run', 'subhour', 'race', 'conven', 'wellington', 'respect', 'home', 'join', 'paul', 'awesom', 'partner', 'began', 'long', 'road', 'trip', 'taupo', 'everyon', 'pretti', 'relax', 'paul', 'job', 'physic', 'easi', 'potenti', 'psycholog', 'tricki', 'depend', 'mental', 'state', 'mani', 'hour', 'yonni', 'relax', 'good', 'train', 'run', 'week', 'lead', 'event', 'concern', 'base', 'around', 'ambit', 'stay', 'entir', 'race', 'anoth', 'fatherandson', 'starttofinish', 'outing', 'dinner', 'pretaupo', 'tradit', 'pauli', 'burger', 'joint', 'pro', 'tip', 'taupo', 'visit', 'pauli', 'least', 'fat', 'carb', 'level', 'well', 'prime', 'race', 'set', 'burger', 'consum', 'let', 'track', 'link', 'bio', 'post', 'share', 'yonni', 'kepe', 'oct', 'pdt', 'rise', 'saturday', 'prerac', 'breakfast', 'drive', 'start', 'ensu', 'line', 'readi', 'swing', 'bridg', 'cross', 'hundr', 'metr', 'yonni', 'agre', 'start', 'front', 'hit', 'bridg', 'near', 'front', 'success', 'potenti', 'danger', 'move', 'kept', 'similar', 'high', 'pace', 'consist', 'run', 'well', 'minut', 'kilometr', 'henc', 'upon', 'goal', 'pace', 'hour', 'race']",0.0,0.30355823040008545,0.23637229204177856,0.0,0.45974650979042053,4,user;

We didn’t hang around long – just enough to down some food and guzzle some Coke.  Headlamps off and we settled into our pace. The field was already spread out at this stage and, other than one or two other competitors, it was pretty much just Yonni and I running together and chatting about our race strategy. After 15km I stacked it going around a gravelly hairpin corner and hit the deck relatively hard grazing my hand and leg. I also felt a fair amount of pain in my left knee that had me hobbling for a few kilometres. Luckily the damage was minimal and I loosened up relatively quickly. After around 25km of single-track, we embarked on a pretty dreary short section of farmland which was long, straight and surprisingly tricky to run over with big clumps of grass to roll unsuspecting ankles. After this section, we came to the first real aid station where Paul and Jo were waiting for us. It was awesome to have their support and encouragement and the spectators generally were amazing – the fact we were near the pointy end and were wearing matching Hagley Hombres bright yellow tops provided some entertainment, I guess. From this aid station, there is a section of farmland and forestry roads. We were nearing a marathon already and, while we were still relatively fresh, there was a degree of fatigue creeping in. I recall a few comments between Yonni and I questioning the pace we were going at – we were not only blowing away my time splits from the 2017 race, but we were also well under our A target pace for 10 hours. Coming out of the forestry we embarked on close to 10km of gravel and then sealed road. On the one hand, it was nice to be able to run on a good surface and hence relax a little and not worry about foot placement. On the other, this section has no respite and any descent into walking pretty much means your race is going south. Luckily we both felt good enough to run this entire section (even joined at one stage by Paul and Jo running alongside us) with some decent pace and we came into the halfway mark well under our five-hour time goal. At this point we bumped into buddies Kerry and Ali, coaches at Squadrun and, as has become a tradition when I see Kerry at races, I dropped to the ground to do a few press-ups. From the 50km mark, the race heads downhill for about 15km along lovely flowy single-track. This was a chance to really get the legs rolling and pick up some good time. We, unfortunately, arrived at the 50kn mark only a few minutes after the competitors in the 50km race left and so we had a huge number of people to pass. It’s actually really draining to have to call out to people to let them know you’re coming through and the stop/start nature that a congested trail cause is difficult. Everyone was great, however, and gave us much support as we passed. We both had a slight low point at this stage of the race – 60 kilometres in well under 5 hours was taking its toll and we were looking forward to getting to Kinloch. At Kinloch, competitors pop out into the village and head off on a short bush loop just out of town. Thereafter they come to the next big aid station at 76kilometres. On the bush loop, we were joined by another 100km solo competitor and, spurred on by this competition, upped the pace a little bit to stay in front of him.",kinloch was a final chance to fuel up

Energy levels were low and the legs were a bit fried. Yonni was a bit annoyed when the 100km solo competitor we’d gotten ahead of near Kinloch passed us and I wasn’t keen to try and stick to him. At this stage, we were shuffling pretty slowly and I was the weakest link. In part because of the way I felt, but also being mindful of what we still had to do, I cautioned Yonni that we should stick to our pace and not try and run ahead. Luckily we were joined by Scotty Stevenson, a buddy we’d raced with earlier in the year at the Old Ghost Ultra. Scotty is one of the most positive people around and between him and a Taupo local who was running with him, we had some awesome pace setters to run behind. At this point, the race does a 10km loop on the headland. It’s a really demoralising feeling having to do what is essentially a 10km detour 85 kilometres into the race. I was feeling pretty good but the wheels were falling off for Yonni a bit. We managed to stick with our pacing mates for most of it but it really wasn’t pretty. I had a fall (after which I inexplicably reached out to shake Scotty’s hand) and Yonni started locking up with cramp. For anyone who hasn’t witnessed it, seeing an ultra runner go into full-body cramps is wildly entertaining, but plays havoc with pacing plans. At the final aid station with 8km to go, it was obvious that Yonni’s tank was empty and we just had to nurse him to the finish line. There wasn’t a lot of running from this stage, and what with frequent cramping episodes, our split time for the last section was pretty slow. Yonni made a valiant effort to start running again with about 5km to go since our 10-hour goal was still doable, but he really didn’t have anything left and reverted to a walk pretty quickly. With about 1500m to go, runners exit the bush, cross a cattle stile and have a short gravel road section up to the finish line. As a video that was helpfully taken by our buddy, Leslie, shows, Yonni kept up his cramping episodes right into the last few metres. Good times out on the Lake Taupo trails yesterday 💥🏃 A post shared by  Yonni Kepes (@yonnikepes) on Oct 10, 2020 at 11:03pm PDT    We crossed the line together, with a final time of 10:05 – slightly over our A goal, but still awesome nonetheless. For a father and son pairing (in which one is too old to be good anymore and the other is well short of peak ultra running age) to get 8th equal place out of a field of a couple of hundred racers is awesome and I hope a few parents got some ideas about doing these sort of things with their own progeny.  ",  the next km saw me at the lowest id been in the race. energy levels were low and the legs were a bit fried. yonni was a bit annoyed when the km solo competitor wed gotten ahead of near kinloch passed us and i wasnt keen to try and stick to him. at this stage we were shuffling pretty slowly and i was the weakest link. in part because of the way i felt but also being mindful of what we still had to do i cautioned yonni that we should stick to our pace and not try and run ahead. luckily we were joined by scotty stevenson a buddy wed raced with earlier in the year at the old ghost ultra. scotty is one of the most positive people around and between him and a taupo local who was running with him we had some awesome pace setters to run behind. at this point the race does a km loop on the headland. its a really demoralising feeling having to do what is essentially a km detour  kilometres into the race. i was feeling pretty good but the wheels were falling off for yonni a bit. we managed to stick with our pacing mates for most of it but it really wasnt pretty. i had a fall after which i inexplicably reached out to shake scottys hand and yonni started locking up with cramp. for anyone who hasnt witnessed it seeing an ultra runner go into fullbody cramps is wildly entertaining but plays havoc with pacing plans. at the final aid station with km to go it was obvious that yonnis tank was empty and we just had to nurse him to the finish line. there wasnt a lot of running from this stage and what with frequent cramping episodes our split time for the last section was pretty slow. yonni made a valiant effort to start running again with about km to go since our hour goal was still doable but he really didnt have anything left and reverted to a walk pretty quickly. with about m to go runners exit the bush cross a cattle stile and have a short gravel road section up to the finish line. as a video that was helpfully taken by our buddy leslie shows yonni kept up his cramping episodes right into the last few metres. good times out on the lake taupo trails yesterday  a post shared by  yonni kepes   on oct   at pm pdt   we crossed the line together with a final time of   slightly over our a goal but still awesome nonetheless. for a father and son pairing in which one is too old to be good anymore and the other is well short of peak ultra running age to get th equal place out of a field of a couple of hundred racers is awesome and i hope a few parents got some ideas about doing these sort of things with their own progeny. ,20,0.047,0.79,0.163,0.9971,23.17323875427246,"['next', 'saw', 'lowest', 'race', 'energi', 'level', 'low', 'leg', 'bit', 'fri', 'yonni', 'bit', 'annoy', 'solo', 'competitor', 'wed', 'gotten', 'ahead', 'near', 'kinloch', 'pas', 'wasnt', 'keen', 'tri', 'stick', 'stage', 'shuffl', 'pretti', 'slowli', 'weakest', 'link', 'part', 'way', 'felt', 'mind', 'still', 'caution', 'yonni', 'stick', 'pace', 'tri', 'run', 'ahead', 'luckili', 'join', 'scotti', 'stevenson', 'buddi', 'wed', 'race', 'earlier', 'year', 'old', 'ghost', 'ultra', 'scotti', 'posit', 'peopl', 'around', 'taupo', 'local', 'run', 'awesom', 'pace', 'setter', 'run', 'behind', 'point', 'race', 'loop', 'headland', 'realli', 'demoralis', 'feel', 'essenti', 'detour', 'kilometr', 'race', 'feel', 'pretti', 'good', 'wheel', 'fall', 'yonni', 'bit', 'manag', 'stick', 'pace', 'mate', 'realli', 'wasnt', 'pretti', 'fall', 'inexplic', 'reach', 'shake', 'scotti', 'hand', 'yonni', 'start', 'lock', 'cramp', 'anyon', 'hasnt', 'wit', 'see', 'ultra', 'runner', 'fullbodi', 'cramp', 'wild', 'entertain', 'play', 'havoc', 'pace', 'plan', 'final', 'aid', 'station', 'obvious', 'yonni', 'tank', 'empti', 'nurs', 'finish', 'wasnt', 'lot', 'run', 'stage', 'frequent', 'cramp', 'episod', 'split', 'time', 'last', 'section', 'pretti', 'slow', 'yonni', 'made', 'valiant', 'effort', 'start', 'run', 'sinc', 'hour', 'goal', 'still', 'doabl', 'realli', 'didnt', 'anyth', 'left', 'revert', 'walk', 'pretti', 'quick', 'runner', 'exit', 'bush', 'cross', 'cattl', 'stile', 'short', 'gravel', 'road', 'section', 'finish', 'video', 'help', 'taken', 'buddi', 'lesli', 'show', 'yonni', 'kept', 'cramp', 'episod', 'right', 'last', 'metr', 'good', 'time', 'lake', 'taupo', 'trail', 'yesterday', 'post', 'share', 'yonni', 'kepe', 'oct', 'pdt', 'cross', 'togeth', 'final', 'time', 'slight', 'goal', 'still', 'awesom', 'nonetheless', 'father', 'son', 'pair', 'old', 'good', 'anymor', 'well', 'short', 'peak', 'ultra', 'run', 'age', 'equal', 'place', 'field', 'coupl', 'hundr', 'racer', 'awesom', 'hope', 'parent', 'got', 'idea', 'sort', 'thing', 'progeni']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9993007779121399,4,user;

I wish I’d known you guys were doing that event and I would have joined in too as another ex-Tawa runner. Maybe next year? And also well done to Ed and Paul of course. Cheers, Russell    We quickly jumped in Paul’s truck to head back to meet Ed at the 70km mark in Kinloch. He was still running well and looking really good. Jo did the bush loop with him before we got him fuelled up and sent him and Paul off for the final 24km. We then headed back to Taupo for a shower before going back to the finish line to await their arrival. Unbeknownst to us, Ed had given it pretty much his all to make the final cutoff at the 18km to go mark and, with this goal attained, things started to fall apart. His body started to fail and Paul was pretty worried about the sanity of his continuing. After a few deliberations via text message and the realization that there was no real bail out option, Paul committed to coaching Ed through to the end. Eight or so hours later, Ed stumbled across the finish line looking pretty corpse-like. The team from Totalsport, the race organisers, kept the party going to wait for him and at around 3 am, after being awake for 24 hours, he was done and buried the demons from his 2017 DNF. It’s important to recognise the epic nature of Ed’s race. To be able to keep going when the body is so blown is no mean feat and he should be proud of what he did. Paul richly deserved the finisher’s medal he was given. It is actually physically challenging to walk at the pace he needed to in order to support Ed and, as I have remarked many times over the 35 years that we’ve known each other, his positivity, can-do attitude and simple common sense is inspiring and I feel privileged to call him a friend. Jo absolutely deserves a shout out here – spending an entire weekend with smelly guys talking about ridiculous sporting quests and farting a lot isn’t most women’s ideas of a good time. You’re a good ‘un and Paul is lucky to have found you. Lastly an acknowledgment to junior. While I’m absolutely justified in hassling you a bit for your smack talk that proved to be well off the mark, to be achieving top 10 finishes in national-level races is epic. Even more so when one considers that ultra running is generally a sport that people only get good at in their 30s. You’ve got awesome ability and I’m looking forward to watching you from the sidelines when I’m too old and broken to keep up (probably next year, I suspect.) Thanks to everyone who supported us during the race – either from the sidelines or online. The race volunteers, spectators, social media followers and race organisers were all awesome.

continuing. after a few deliberations via text message and the realization that there was no real bail out option paul committed to coaching ed through to the end. eight or so hours later ed stumbled across the finish line looking pretty corpselike. the team from totalsport the race organisers kept the party going to wait for him and at around  am after being awake for  hours he was done and buried the demons from his  dnf. its important to recognise the epic nature of eds race. to be able to keep going when the body is so blown is no mean feat and he should be proud of what he did. paul richly deserved the finishers medal he was given. it is actually physically challenging to walk at the pace he needed to in order to support ed and as i have remarked many times over the  years that weve known each other his positivity cando attitude and simple common sense is inspiring and i feel privileged to call him a friend. jo absolutely deserves a shout out here  spending an entire weekend with smelly guys talking about ridiculous sporting quests and farting a lot isnt most womens ideas of a good time. youre a good un and paul is lucky to have found you. lastly an acknowledgment to junior. while im absolutely justified in hassling you a bit for your smack talk that proved to be well off the mark to be achieving top  finishes in nationallevel races is epic. even more so when one considers that ultra running is generally a sport that people only get good at in their s. youve got awesome ability and im looking forward to watching you from the sidelines when im too old and broken to keep up probably next year i suspect. thanks to everyone who supported us during the race  either from the sidelines or online. the race volunteers spectators social media followers and race organisers were all awesome. and finally some words inspired by eds quest if you think you can or you think you cant youre right. ben kepes is a technology evangelist an investor a commentator and a

Steve Prentice   Lauren Brunson   Kevin Julian   Sekhar Sarukkai   Mary Stanhope   Matt Holleran   Mike Johnson   Mark Banfield   Patrick Joggerst  To my understanding, a cloud roadmap is an essential requirement both for the whole cloud journey and for the business. For example, if we were talking about a trip to another country, you would want to plan as much as possible, wouldn’t you? You would need to understand the dates, the budget, logistics etc. if you didn’t – things might go wrong. Cloud is not just a technology. It’s the backbone, a foundation. For some companies, it’s the foundation for an entire business — they will be building products in cloud, they will be running their solutions in the cloud, and everything that is in the cloud is subject to security, compliance, performance, costs. You would be thinking in terms of how you would be building your platform, solutions, and your business because you are in the cloud. You need to think about: What is the best way to begin building a cloud roadmap? The best way is to look at where you are right now. Then answer the question: what is the conceptual state you want to be in as a company and as a technology unit in, say, 3-5 years? Again – you might want to think conceptually rather than from an implementation standpoint. Don’t try to think in terms of lines of business for your data warehouse right away. Think conceptually: whether you want to be cloud-agnostic, what kind of technologies you want to leverage, what type of data you want to store, what kind of cultural or technology principles you want to follow in your company. To return to my first point, cloud is a backbone and a platform for all of your technology and your entire business.

81,84,CloudTweaks | Building a Cloud Roadmap,https://cloudtweaks.com/2020/09/building-a-cloud-roadmap/,2020-10-05,"The cloud journey does not only consist of these initial steps. It doesn’t end when you achieve your desired state because it’s a living thing. It’s like a fluid living thing. You always have to keep the momentum, pursue new technologies, understand trends, follow what is happening and continuously improve what you have in your software and your clouds. There always will be room for optimization.  What is your first step going to be? How do you select the cloud platform? To understand the state of your cloud, you need to have an understanding of the type of automation and solutions you will have there. I’m not talking about metrics or application performance here. I’m talking about an overall holistic view over your cloud infrastructure and everything that you have there: security, budget, consumers, groups that use cloud, and opportunities that cloud gives you. Here a cloud is not only one provider, but it’s also a group of services. It’s a foundational kind of family of cloud, native services, and everything that is happening there. Other than the initial and end state, think about ‘’what is the first project/line of business that will go there?” Think about designing your cloud, the roadmap itself, the architecture. Think about the moment when you will probably change your company. If you don’t do DevOps, you will be doing DevOps. If you don’t know what SRE is, you will have to adopt SRE because this is where the industry is going. This is what is working right now. And to some degree or another, this cloud roadmap will affect many areas of your company. Change the culture. Adopt new technologies. Then, from the roadmap standpoint, other than changing culture, adopting new tech, and educating your staff, you need to think about ways your engineers and developers can leverage clouds. Whether it’s an extension to their development environment, a sandbox where you run your non-production systems, your staging or QA, or a special lab where you run your ML notebooks and where you build ML models. As a first step, you will have to architect your cloud, and you will have to align your stakeholders, security, compliance, DevOps and SRE, your product people, your engineering. People who do technology in your company will have to learn cloud and will have to be very comfortable with it, understand it and leverage it well. At the same time, you’ll have to get buy-in from your business stakeholder. There will be people evaluating your cloud from a financial standpoint: how much money you spend, why, how we can control it, whether there are any opportunities for cost savings, etc. Try to think about these questions well ahead of time and not when things go sideways.   There will be a lot of work to do when actually moving to the cloud, transforming your stuff, migrating, re-architecting, re-engineering, re-platforming your solutions, or possibly even decommissioning some of them (because there’s a great chance you will find a better replacement in cloud that actually is a cloud-native solution, not something that you have to run on-premise at the time.)",the cloud journey does not only consist of these initial steps. it doesnt end when you achieve your desired state because its a

At some point, you’ll most likely discover that you need to change the cloud provider, or you will realize that you need to change direction as a company. There should be several layers, several types of these steering meetings. And I think a combination of these different types of meetings will make the most sense.  I would say it should be people across different parts of your organization. It should be security, compliance, technologists, architects, and the head of engineering, for example. It should be your product people. It should be someone who will be closely watching your billing and the financial status of your cloud and how much money you spend, someone who will be receiving these checks because you need to understand the capacity and costs of your cloud. Not for this year, not for next year – but how much will it cost you 3-5 years in advance? Plan in advance. Plus, there is always an operational aspect. These are your DevOps, and SRE (site reliability engineers). An operations department: people with monitors and charts are the first line of support. Include them in your planning as well, because they will have to change, adapt, and learn new things, and they have their own requirements. These are the people you need to include in your cloud roadmap planning. You need to be measuring your progress consistently. You need to understand where you are. Don’t do it too often, or you’ll lose sight of the bigger picture. You cannot do it once every ten years either, because it will not make any sense. I would propose something like steering meetings, where you have a committee that oversees an overall cloud state and your development. The committee can regroup every other month and evaluates your progress. Moreover, every 3-6 months, you might want to have another type of meeting, a sort of a bigger picture meeting, where the team can have a close look at your current state. Are you in line with what is happening in the industry? Are you executing your program as it was planned? What are the challenges?

Yuri holds a MS in computer science from St. Petersburg State University of Information Technology, Mechanics and Optics (Saint Petersburg, Russia).  Here goes: You have a problem. You want to solve it. You have a champion, and you have a project sponsor. And you go in cloud with one line of business, and you want to fix one particular pain point. Or you have people who are familiar with only one cloud provider in your engineering team. Therefore, you do your planning based on their expertise and because they know this cloud very well. This bias from the engineers might affect your planning. As a result, you will spend time, you will spend money, and you will not just spend time and money but you will lose it. And you will have something in a cloud that will be okay. It will work. But you might discover that it is not in line with what you want to achieve. It doesn’t work that well. It won’t work for you in five years when your priorities and mission are different. When someone is in a situation like this, it’s unfortunate to admit that the credibility of the team that planned the cloud journey suffers. It’s hard to start the discussion all over again if you have reputational damage. Because it takes time, it takes investment. If you don’t think holistically about the problem and only rely on some minimal assumptions or technology preferences – you will not achieve a good outcome.

The forward-thinking and agile principles of the IBM Garage Methodology also helped Apleona succeed in its digital transformation. Apleona and IBM continue to follow this methodology at the IBM Watson IoT Center, which serves as the team’s co-creation space. This location even boasts the Room Booking solution. While the real estate industry has recognized the general benefits of digitization, critical voices are still asking for detailed business cases and quantifiable cost savings. How do you quickly scale the new solutions? “In our industry, innovation and monetization must always be thought of together,” explains Dr. Jochen Keysberg, Chief Executive Officer at Apleona. “That’s why it’s so important that new ideas, such as those developed with IBM, always have competitive advantages, efficiency improvements and better resource utilization in mind.” The real estate industry cannot shy away from digitization, and like Apleona, other facility managers will have to adopt modern solutions to succeed in the marketplace. “Simply start, develop agile and at the same time, bring the required expertise to the table. Then quickly validate and test it with the addressed users. In our experience, it usually works in a quite straightforward way,” explains Stefan Lutz, General Manager and Services Transformation Program Leader at IBM. Indeed, new customers, including a major German bank and global companies in the technology, energy and automation industries, are already relying on the innovation of Apleona and IBM. In addition, other IBM locations will soon use Apleona’s cutting-edge solutions, and more applications will roll out in 2020.

98,101,New – Redis 6 Compatibility for Amazon ElastiCache | AWS News Blog,https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-redis-6-compatibility-for-amazon-elasticache/,2020-10-05,"If you want to create, modify, and delete users and user groups, you will need to select to the User Management and User Group Management sections in the ElastiCache console.  After the last Redis 5.0 compatibility for Amazon ElastiCache, there has been lots of improvements to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis including upstream supports such as 5.0.6. Earlier this year, we announced Global Datastore for Redis that lets you replicate a cluster in one region to clusters in up to two other regions. Recently we improved your ability to monitor your Redis fleet by enabling 18 additional engine and node-level CloudWatch metrics. Also, we added support for resource-level permission policies, allowing you to assign AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) principal permissions to specific ElastiCache resource or resources. Today, I am happy to announce Redis 6 compatibility to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. This release brings several new and important features to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis: Note that open source Redis 6 also announced support for encryption-in-transit, a capability that is already available in Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 4.0.10 onwards. This release of Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 6 does not impact Amazon ElastiCache for Redis’ existing support for encryption-in-transit. In order to apply RBAC to a new or existing Redis 6 cluster, we first need to ensure you have a user and user group created. We’ll review the process to do this below. Using Role-Based Access Control – How it works An alternative to Authenticating Users with the Redis AUTH Command, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 6 offers Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

ElastiCache will automatically configure a default user with user ID and user name “default”, and then you can add it or new created users to new groups in User Group Management.  If you want to change the default user with your own password and access setting, you need to create a new user with the username set to “default” and can then swap it with the original default user. We recommend using your own strong password for a default user. The following example shows how to swap the original default user with another default that has a modified access string via AWS CLI. Create a user group and add the user you created previously. Swap the new default user with the original default user. Also, you can modify a user’s password or change its access permissions using modify-user command, or remove a specific user using delete-user command. It will be removed from any user groups to which it belongs. Similarly you can modify a user group by adding new users and/or removing current users using modify-user-group command, or delete a user group using delete-user-group command.

105,108,All Things Distributed - All Things Distributed,https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/,2020-10-05,"A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;   Running a business at the scale of Amazon, we often have to solve
problems that no other company has faced before. The disadvantage of
this is that there is no “how to” guide for us—a lot is unknown.
However, the advantage is that when we solve a new problem, it’s an
opportunity to reinvent our services and create new benefits for our
customers. Indeed, we have created some of our most innovative and
successful ideas when we have entered unchartered territory. When you’re a customer-centric company, you often find yourself in the
great unknown because customers will always want more and better. You
will need to invent on their behalf. A great example of this approach to
innovation and problem solving is the creation of the AWS Nitro
System, the
underlying platform for our EC2 instances. After years of optimizing traditional virtualization systems to the
limit, we knew we had to make a dramatic change in the architecture if
we were going to continue to increase performance and security for our
customers. This realization forced us to rethink everything and became
the spark for our creating the Nitro System, the first infrastructure
platform to offload virtualization functions to dedicated hardware and
software. Now, with the Nitro System, we can offer the best price
performance in the cloud, the most secure environment, and a faster pace
of innovation. Continue reading...  I have always been very fortunate to meet our AWS customers where they have most impact, at their customers.

In the first season, we had a wonderful diverse group of young businesses showing their impact on the world.

Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
S. Quarterman. It was the first authoritative description of Berkeley
UNIX, its
design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
text book would never give you. In those days I was doing an internship at
NIKHEF who were still using a collection of
PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
hands dirty. When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
with a list of other books I had also read from that era. Continue reading...  One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different

my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
opportunity. But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
daunting. Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.

explained that he was working with governors from across the country to
model the potential impact of COVID-19 for scenario planning. He wanted
to help them answer critical questions, like “How many hospital beds
will we need?” and “Can we reduce the spread if we temporarily close
places where people gather?” and “Should we issue a shelter-in-place
order and for how long?” While nobody can predict the future, modeling
the virus with all the factors they did know was their best shot at
helping leaders make informed decisions, which would impact hundreds of
thousands of lives.   The global healthcare pandemic has been like nothing many of us in
Europe have ever known. During this time, many organizations have been
contemplating their role in the COVID-19 crisis, and how they can best
serve their communities. I can tell you it has been no different for us
at Amazon Web Services (AWS). We are focused on where we can make the
biggest difference, to help the global communities in which we all live
and work. This is why today we are announcing that the AWS Europe
(Milan) Region is now
open. The opening of the
AWS (Milan) Region demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the people of
Italy and the long-term potential we believe there is in the country. Continue reading...  La maggior parte di noi, in Europa, non aveva mai conosciuto prima una

With enough relationship data points, you can even make predictions about the future (like with a recommendation engine). But as more data is connected, and the size and complexity of the connected data increases, the relationships become more complicated to store and query.  Continue reading...  Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 fulfillment centers (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day. Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster. That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it. A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake. Continue reading...  Have you ever received a call from your bank because they suspected fraudulent activity?
